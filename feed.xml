Wouldn't be nice to save all the triggers settings, instruments sounds, etc. for this drum kit, so that anyone can play with the TD-4KP?

If you click on the link, you'll notice that there's a little Readme file to help you install the kit.
It's a very simple and quick operation.

With any luck, reading this post will make you want to export some of your kits.
I think this is one of the steps that will add a social dimension to exadrums, so be prepared to see more things going in that direction in the future!

            <description><![CDATA[Today, Debian 11 (Bullseye), has been officially released. This is a great news for exadrums, as this means it is now available in Debian. If you're using Debian (or Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and some other distros), you can install exadrums via apt, i.e.:

Today, Debian 11 (Bullseye), has been officially released. This is a great news for *exadrums*, as this means it is now available in Debian. If you're using Debian (or Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and some [other distros](https://repology.org/project/exadrums/packages)), you can install exadrums via `apt`, i.e.:

```bash
sudo apt install exadrums
```
<!--more-->

## What does this mean?

Well, if you have about 5 MB to spare, you can install exadrums from the command line directly.
Here's what you see from a fresh Debian Bullseye install:

![image](/images/debian-bullseye/Screenshot_2021-08-15_11-14-02.png)

No more compiling, etc. `apt` handles everything for you!

## What about Raspberry Pi OS?

It's only been a few hours since Debian 11 has been released, so there's no news about the next Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian). Let's give them some time to publish a proper release.
I can already tell you that you'll get the same version of exadrums as Debian in Raspberry Pi OS, it'll be exadrums 0.6.0.

Anyhow, when the new Raspberry Pi OS will be released, you'll be able to install exadrums via `apt` on your Raspberry Pi.

## Using Debian Bullseye on a Raspberry Pi

If you don't want to wait until the version of Raspberry Pi OS comes out, you can install Debian Bullseye on your Raspberry Pi using one of the images available at: [ Tested images](https://raspi.debian.net/tested-images/). I haven't tried any of them, but they've been tested, so they should work.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The official exadrums website, exadrums.com, is online.
It shows that there's more than a just software to exadrums.
Even though it is more a landing page than a website, it gives valuable information about the project.

The website's goal is also to explain how to build an exadrums module.
Building the whole module (which is currently designed to work with the Roland TD4-KP), requires three main steps:

- To install the software on a Raspberry Pi
- To make the trigger input board.
- To 3D-print the enclosure.

Just so you know, you don't have to go through each step, as you can already play a fair bit with the software even on your PC or laptop.

There is also this _Make your Own_ button, which redirects to another web page that is currently under construction.
This page will be a custom user guide generator.

The idea is that everyone wants something different (or have a different drum set configuration), so it makes sense to have a custom user guide.
I'll keep you informed about the progress I make on that page.
It should be available in a few weeks, or a few months.
I'm not in a rush, as my goal is to make the best user guide possible.

            <description><![CDATA[Over the past few years, I've worked on improving exadrums to make it as complete as possible.
However, before that, I spent a lot of time making sure the software and hardware would meet some very specific requirements.
On the software side, the latency had to be below 10ms, and the sound quality at least as good as our dear old compact discs.
And on the hardware side, the trigger input board had to preserve the piezos' dynamics, and be compatible with most edrums out there.
Achieving all of this wasn't an easy task, and took about three years, from September 2015 to September 2018.
Moreover, exadrums had to be a modern and accessible drum module. Which is why it is based on the Raspberry Pi (2+) and uses a 7" touchscreen. So, September 2018 was the confirmation that all those targets were reached, and it was time to write down how all these things came together.]]></description>

## How to Make it Work as Expected?

About three years ago, I wrote a short article that describes how and why I defined the software and hardware requirements, but also how I managed to make everything work as expected. I'll go into a bit more details below, but you can skip that part if you're in a hurry, and go straight to the article.

## Making a Modern Drum Module

Making a modern drum module means breaking the rules. Nearly a hundred percent of the existing drum modules use a microcontroller to leverage their real-time properties. However, that means that the amount of memory is often limited, and the user interface is rudimentary (buttons, sliders, etc.), and can't evolve without modifying the hardware.

By choosing the Raspberry Pi, I made it possible to have a modern user interface, using a touchscreen, but I lost all the real-time goodness that microcontrollers have to offer.
Fortunately, there was a solution to reduce the latency with a Raspberry Pi.
Unsurprisingly, getting more performance means going low-level, but also getting a good soundcard.
The soundcard latency represents a third of the total latency.
The software adds another third, and the last third is the trigger scan time.

## Making a Trigger Input Board

Making a trigger input board, is not overly complicated. But there are still two big challenges:

- Make sure all the components fit on the board.
- Find a way to make the board compatible with all the drum pads out there.

The first challenge is not too hard, thanks to SMD components. Especially for a 8-input board. That'll be a bit more difficult with 16 inputs...
As for making the board compatible with all the drum pads, I decided to connect potentiometers to the piezos, so that their output voltage can be scaled down if necessary. That avoids the biggest problem: clipping!

Now that you've got the context, maybe you'd like to read the article, so here it is.

The future of exadrums is probably different than what you may think.

So far, exadrums is a two-part software, there's a library, libexadrums, and another component: the user interface. The whole drum module is in the library, and exposes a C++ API. That means libexadrums can be used with other languages, such as Python, Javascript, etc.

<!--more-->

A C++ user interface has its advantages, but exadrums could benefit from other languages. For instance,  a more "connected" experience would be easier to implement in Python or Javascript.

And that's how I see the future of exadrums: a Connected Open Source Drum Module. Some things are already in the works, but others will take some time. However, I'll do my best to publish news more frequently, to keep you informed about the project.

About that, the project website [exadrums.com](https://exadrums.com) will be online pretty soon! Hope you'll like it.
