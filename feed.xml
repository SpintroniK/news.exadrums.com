Today, Debian 11 (Bullseye), has been officially released. This is a great news for *exadrums*, as this means it is now available in Debian. If you're using Debian (or Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and some [other distros](https://repology.org/project/exadrums/packages)), you can install exadrums via `apt`, i.e.:

```bash
sudo apt install exadrums
```
<!--more-->

## What does this mean?

Well, if you have about 5 MB to spare, you can install exadrums from the command line directly.
Here's what you see from a fresh Debian Bullseye install:

No more compiling, etc. `apt` handles everything for you!

## What about Raspberry Pi OS?

It's only been a few hours since Debian 11 has been released, so there's no news about the next Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian). Let's give them some time to publish a proper release.
I can already tell you that you'll get the same version of exadrums as Debian in Raspberry Pi OS, it'll be exadrums 0.6.0.

Anyhow, when the new Raspberry Pi OS will be released, you'll be able to install exadrums via `apt` on your Raspberry Pi.

## Using Debian Bullseye on a Raspberry Pi

If you don't want to wait until the version of Raspberry Pi OS comes out, you can install Debian Bullseye on your Raspberry Pi using one of the images available at: [ Tested images](https://raspi.debian.net/tested-images/). I haven't tried any of them, but they've been tested, so they should work.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The official exadrums website, exadrums.com, is online.
It shows that there's more than a just software to exadrums.
Even though it is more a landing page than a website, it gives valuable information about the project.
And frankly, I'm quite proud of the video!

The website's goal is also to explain how to build an exadrums module.
Building the whole module (which is currently designed to work with the Roland TD4-KP), requires three main steps:

- To install the software on a Raspberry Pi
- To make the trigger input board.
- To 3D-print the enclosure.

Just so you know, you don't have to go through each step, as you can already play a fair bit with the software even on your PC or laptop.

There is also this _Make your Own_ button, which redirects to another web page that is currently under construction.
This page will be a custom user guide generator.

The idea is that everyone wants something different (or have a different drum set configuration), so it makes sense to have a custom user guide.
I'll keep you informed about the progress I make on that page.
It should be available in a few weeks, or a few months.
I'm not in a rush, as my goal is to make the best user guide possible.

The future of exadrums is probably different than what you may think.

So far, exadrums is a two-part software, there's a library, libexadrums, and another component: the user interface. The whole drum module is in the library, and exposes a C++ API. That means libexadrums can be used with other languages, such as Python, Javascript, etc.

<!--more-->

A C++ user interface has its advantages, but exadrums could benefit from other languages. For instance,  a more "connected" experience would be easier to implement in Python or Javascript.

And that's how I see the future of exadrums: a Connected Open Source Drum Module. Some things are already in the works, but others will take some time. However, I'll do my best to publish news more frequently, to keep you informed about the project.

About that, the project website [exadrums.com](https://exadrums.com) will be online pretty soon! Hope you'll like it.
