If you click on the link, you'll notice that there's a little Readme file to help you install the kit.
It's a very simple and quick operation.

With any luck, reading this post will make you want to export some of your kits.
I think this is one of the steps that will add a social dimension to exadrums, so be prepared to see more things going in that direction in the future!

            <description><![CDATA[Today, Debian 11 (Bullseye), has been officially released. This is a great news for exadrums, as this means it is now available in Debian. If you're using Debian (or Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and some other distros), you can install exadrums via apt, i.e.:

Today, Debian 11 (Bullseye), has been officially released. This is a great news for *exadrums*, as this means it is now available in Debian. If you're using Debian (or Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and some [other distros](https://repology.org/project/exadrums/packages)), you can install exadrums via `apt`, i.e.:

```bash
sudo apt install exadrums
```
<!--more-->

## What does this mean?

Well, if you have about 5 MB to spare, you can install exadrums from the command line directly.
Here's what you see from a fresh Debian Bullseye install:

![image](/images/debian-bullseye/Screenshot_2021-08-15_11-14-02.png)

No more compiling, etc. `apt` handles everything for you!

## What about Raspberry Pi OS?

It's only been a few hours since Debian 11 has been released, so there's no news about the next Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian). Let's give them some time to publish a proper release.
I can already tell you that you'll get the same version of exadrums as Debian in Raspberry Pi OS, it'll be exadrums 0.6.0.

Anyhow, when the new Raspberry Pi OS will be released, you'll be able to install exadrums via `apt` on your Raspberry Pi.

## Using Debian Bullseye on a Raspberry Pi

If you don't want to wait until the version of Raspberry Pi OS comes out, you can install Debian Bullseye on your Raspberry Pi using one of the images available at: [ Tested images](https://raspi.debian.net/tested-images/). I haven't tried any of them, but they've been tested, so they should work.]]></content:encoded>

The website's goal is also to explain how to build an exadrums module.
Building the whole module (which is currently designed to work with the Roland TD4-KP), requires three main steps:

- To install the software on a Raspberry Pi
- To make the trigger input board.
- To 3D-print the enclosure.

Just so you know, you don't have to go through each step, as you can already play a fair bit with the software even on your PC or laptop.

There is also this _Make your Own_ button, which redirects to another web page that is currently under construction.
This page will be a custom user guide generator.

The idea is that everyone wants something different (or have a different drum set configuration), so it makes sense to have a custom user guide.
I'll keep you informed about the progress I make on that page.
It should be available in a few weeks, or a few months.
I'm not in a rush, as my goal is to make the best user guide possible.

## How to Make it Work as Expected?

About three years ago, I wrote a short article that describes how and why I defined the software and hardware requirements, but also how I managed to make everything work as expected. I'll go into a bit more details below, but you can skip that part if you're in a hurry, and go straight to the article.

## Making a Modern Drum Module

Making a modern drum module means breaking the rules. Nearly a hundred percent of the existing drum modules use a microcontroller to leverage their real-time properties. However, that means that the amount of memory is often limited, and the user interface is rudimentary (buttons, sliders, etc.), and can't evolve without modifying the hardware.

By choosing the Raspberry Pi, I made it possible to have a modern user interface, using a touchscreen, but I lost all the real-time goodness that microcontrollers have to offer.
Fortunately, there was a solution to reduce the latency with a Raspberry Pi.
Unsurprisingly, getting more performance means going low-level, but also getting a good soundcard.
The soundcard latency represents a third of the total latency.
The software adds another third, and the last third is the trigger scan time.

## Making a Trigger Input Board

Making a trigger input board, is not overly complicated. But there are still two big challenges:

- Make sure all the components fit on the board.
- Find a way to make the board compatible with all the drum pads out there.

The first challenge is not too hard, thanks to SMD components. Especially for a 8-input board. That'll be a bit more difficult with 16 inputs...
As for making the board compatible with all the drum pads, I decided to connect potentiometers to the piezos, so that their output voltage can be scaled down if necessary. That avoids the biggest problem: clipping!

            <description><![CDATA[Achieving low latency and performance for exadrums was possible thanks to the C++ programming language.
C++ is a great language because it offers both low- and high-level programming styles, but I find it a bit limited when it comes to user interfaces.
On the other hand, javascript isn't the best language for performance, but or user interfaces it really shines, thanks to its integration with html and css.
But can we get a nice and responsive html + css + js user interface, and get the C++ performance?
That's what libexadrums.js does.
It is basically javascript a wrapper of the exadrums C++ library (libexadrums).
Using the Node-API interface, (lib)exadrums can be used in any nodejs project, with almost no performance loss.

That's what [libexadrums.js](https://github.com/SpintroniK/libexadrums.js) does.

<!--more-->

## How it works

The way libexadrums.js works is very simple, it is just a javascript wrapper around the original C++ library.
Every function call is translated from javascript to a C++ function call.

So when you start your drum module, a javascript function calls the C++ start function, which in turns starts the module.
But the cool thing is, once the module has started, it runs the native compiled C++ program, so there's no performance hit whatsoever.
That way, you do get the best of both worlds.

## What's next?

So far, libexadrums.js is not complete, some functions are missing, and it will take some time to add them.
But the main goal is to make a better user interface.
The plan is to develop an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application, that will become an alternative to the native C++ interface.
I don't think it will replace it, but it'll be used by people who want a more connected experience.

Imagine a user interface than leverages CSS transitions, animations, together with [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/), and javascript's fetch api. I think that can make the development easier, and faster. And hopefully drummers that use exadrums will highly benefit from that!

Remember this article about [exadrums becoming an official Debian package](article/debian-bullseye)?

The Raspberry Pi Foundation released the latest Raspberry Pi OS *bullseye* a few days ago, and as you may have guessed, it includes exadrums packages:

![image](/images/raspberry-pi-os-bullseye/screenshot.png)

Now, you simply have to type `sudo apt install exadrums` into a terminal to install exadrums on your Raspberry Pi.

<!--more-->

It took some time to get to that point, but you get exadrums 0.6.0, which fairly recent, and works on my Roland TD-4KP drum set.
If you'd like to try exadrums with your TD-4KP drum set, it's quite easy.
First of all, you'll need to install *zip*, as it's not installed by default: `sudo apt install zip`.
Then, you can go to the following page: https://github.com/SpintroniK/exadrums-data/tree/TD-4KP and follow the instructions.

Obviously, the project is still under development and future versions will support more inputs, and have a lot of improvements.
The official documentation is far from being complete, but I'll make sure to add guidelines to help install the latest version of exadrums on a Raspberry Pi. I will make sure the future versions work on the current version of Raspberry Pi OS *bullseye*. Stay tuned, new versions are coming!

A C++ user interface has its advantages, but exadrums could benefit from other languages. For instance,  a more "connected" experience would be easier to implement in Python or Javascript.

And that's how I see the future of exadrums: a Connected Open Source Drum Module. Some things are already in the works, but others will take some time. However, I'll do my best to publish news more frequently, to keep you informed about the project.

About that, the project website [exadrums.com](https://exadrums.com) will be online pretty soon! Hope you'll like it.

This means that it'll become possible to add more inputs to the trigger input board, by adding more analog to digital converters.

## How SPI Devices Work

An SPI analog to digital converter takes in analog data, digitizes it, and sends it to a Raspberry Pi using the SPI bus.
SPI communication offers many advantages, and one of them is that it's quite easy to communicate with several devices.
The first eXaDrums input board uses a single MCP3008 chip, which limits the number of inputs to 8.
Adding another MCP3008 would increase that number to 16, and if you want even more inputs, you could add a third one.

The Raspberry Pi offers at least one SPI interface that has two `Chip Select` inputs (also called *Chip Enable*).
So, with a single SPI bus, `SPI0`, the Raspberry Pi can communicate with two devices, by changing the states of the chip selects pins `CE0` and `CE1`.

But that's not it. Recent Raspberry Pis have another SPI *bus*: `SPI1`. And it can handle up to three devices via its three chip select inputs `CE0`, `CE1`, and `CE2`.
So, in theory it's possible to have up to 5 SPI Analog to Digital converters. Imagine 5 MCP3008, that would mean up to 40 inputs!
Note that the Raspberry Pi 4 has even more SPI buses, so that should be more than enough, even for a big drum kit with a lot of triggers.

It's important to note that SPI devices are grouped by bus and chip select, and this is exactly how the SPI configuration works in exadrums.

## How to Configure SPI Devices

Only supported devices are allowed in the SPI configuration dialog. They are currently limited to MCP3008, MCP3204, and MCP3208.
Each device must be associated to a bus and a chip select.
And that's basically it.

Here is an example.
You make a trigger input board that needs to handle up to 16 analog inputs.
The MCP3008 is a good choice, so you decide to use two of them.
You can either have one of them use the `SPI0`, and the other the `SPI1`, or you can have them both use `SPI1` and choose to use two different chip selects, i.e. `CE0` and `CE1`.
So your configuration is:
|  Name   | Bus | CS |
|---------|-----|----|
| MCP3008 |  0  |  0 |
| MCP3008 |  0  |  1 |

And this is exactly how you can configure your SPI devices in exadrums (see screenshot above).
By doing that, you'll be able to create up to 16 triggers, numbered 0 to 15, and everything will work out of the box.
