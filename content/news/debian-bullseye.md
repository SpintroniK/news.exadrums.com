title: Debian Bullseye
---

Today, Debian 11, codename Bullseye has been officially released. This is a great news for *exadrums*, as this means it is now available in Debian. If you're using Debian (or Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and potentially some other Debian-based distros), you can install exadrums via `apt`, e.g.: 
```
sudo apt install exadrums
```
