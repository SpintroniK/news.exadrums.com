Instead, there are two 15-position Arduino Nano-compatible female headers.\nAny microcontroller that is pin-compatible with the Arduino Nano will fit.\nFor the rest of this post, I'll assume that the microcontroller is an Arduino Nano Every.\n\nBut before we dive into the details, check out that board!\n\n![image](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/board.png)\n![image](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/board-arduino.png)\n\nBoard alone (left), and board with Arduino mounted on (right).\nI went for a blue PCB so that it would match the Arduino's color.\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Board Specs\n\nSo far, with an Arduino Nano Every, I've achieved the following:\n\n- Compatible with Roland TD-9, TD-11, TD-15, TD-17, TD-25, and TD-27-based edrum kits (DB25 connector).\n- Sample rate greater than 70ksps (kilo samples per second).\n- Nearly 9 samples per milliseconds and per channel (8.93 in average).\n- Configurable trigger parameters: threshold, scan time and mask time (1ms step).\n- Configurable MIDI channel and notes.\n\nUsing 7 of the 8 inputs (the pads only), I managed to optimize the firmware quite a bit, as it fits into less than 2k bytes of flash and uses less than 128 bytes of RAM. Of course, this will increase a little when the hi-hat pedal code will be added.\n\n## This New Board is Called TB08-SE\n\nThis new board's name is *eXaDrums TB08-SE*.\nRead *eXaDrums Trigger Board, 8 inputs, Special Edition*.\nI consider this board a special edition because this is the first exadrums board that is MIDI-compliant, and also because it is modular.\nAs you can see on the photos above, the Arduino isn't soldered to the board, which means you can use another microcontroller if you want to (for instance an STM32 Nucleo board). As long as the pinout is compabitle, of course. Note that I don't recommend the Arduino Nano for this board, as its ADC is way too slow. The Arduino Nano Every, on the other hand, is a perfect fit!\n\n## How it Works\n\n### Analog Circuitry\n\nThe analog part of the board is quite straightforward. It uses op-amps and passive components to scale down the piezo voltage to the 0-3.3V range.\nAt rest, the output voltage is 1.65V (3.3V/2).\nAmong the 8 inputs, 7 are intended to be used with single-zone pads, and one is to be used with a hi-hat controller.\n\nHere's how everything is wired:\n\n|  Instrument   | Cable Reference | Arduino Analog Input | ATMega4809 Analog Input |\n|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Kick          |  KIK            |  A0                  |  AIN3                   |\n| Snare         |  SNR            |  A1                  |  AIN2                   |\n| Hi-hat        |  HH             |  A2                  |  AIN1                   |\n| Hi-hat Control|  HHC            |  A3                  |  AIN0                   |\n| Crash         |  CR1            |  A4                  |  AIN12                  |\n| Tom1          |  T1             |  A5                  |  AIN13                  |\n| Tom3          |  T3             |  A6                  |  AIN4                   |\n| Ride          |  RD             |  A7                  |  AIN5                   |\n\n### Arduino Nano Every\n\nI chose the Arduino Nano Every because it's affordable, popular, small, and more importantly, because it has the right specs for the job!\nThe on-board ATMega4809 has plenty of flash and RAM, so I knew these wouldn't cause any issues.\nThe ADC is a crucial element for an edrum project, and the ATMega4809 has a 10-bit ADC that is capable of running at a 115ksps.\nFor a 8-input board, that means about 14 samples per millisecond and per channel, which is quite good (it's recommended to get, at the very least, 5 samples per ms and per channel. But usually, [it's best to get around 10 samples/ms/channel](https://www.vdrums.com/forum/advanced/technical/1215866-edrumin-let-s-talk-about-it?p=1216107#post1216107)).\n\nHowever, the ATMega4809 isn't a powerful beast.

If you haven't read the previous part here's a link to it: [New Arduino Nano Every Trigger Board - Part 1](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part1).\nIn this part, I'm going to describe how to compile C++ code and upload it to the Arduino Nano Every without using the Arduino library.\n\nBut why would one want to do that, you may ask?\nThe answer is simple: the Arduino library does a lot of things that may impact performance.\nFor instance, some interrupts are being fired frequently, and slow things down.\n\nLet's be honest, we're not going to reinvent the wheel, most of what we are going to do here is to use the Arduino IDE's compiler and tools.\nSay we install the Arduino IDE (version 1.8.9) and compile a program.\nHere's what we're going to see:\n\n![image](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/arduino-ide.png)\n\nThe interesting part is the console, where all the compilation-related messages are shown.\nWe see that the IDE uses avr-gcc version 7.3.0, along with a few other tools.\nLet's see what we can do with that.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nFirst of all, we can see *where* all these tools are located.\nA little digging reveals that an environment variable named *AVR_TOOLS_DIR* contains the tools folder location.\nThus, we can type the following: `$AVR_TOOLS_DIR/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin/avr-gcc --version` and execute the command in a terminal.\nThis will print the avr-gcc version.\n\n## Makefile for the Arduino Nano Every\n\nThis is not a tutorial about makefiles, if you want an in-depth tutorial about makefiles, please read the official [GNU Make Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/).\nWith that out of the way, let's write a makefile.\n\n### Variables\n\nFirst of all, we need to define some variables.\nHaving the avr-gcc bin directory as variable seems like a good idea, so we define the following: `BIN_DIR?=${AVR_TOOLS_DIR}/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin`.\nYour bin directory may differ, so be sure to check its correct location.\nThat's the only variable we'll need for the compiling process.\n\nThere's one more thing that we need in order to upload the compiled program to the Arduino, though.\nThis thing is avrdude.\nIt's a little bit trickier, as we need the avrdude executable and a configuration file.\nSo here are our

executable path.\nIf you want to provide your own configuration file, you can use the following (sorry, it isn't a short

the Arduino IDE (in the *tools* menu).\n\n### Rules\n\nNow that we have defined all the variables that we need, we have to create some rules to compile and upload our code to the Arduino.\nTo that end, we are going to have three rules: `all`, to compile the code, `upload`, to upload the binary to the board, and `clean` to remove all the build files.\n\nLet's start with the `all` rule:\n\n```makefile\nall:\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-g++ -c -g -Os -w -std=c++17 -fpermissive -fno-exceptions -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fno-threadsafe-statics -Wno-error=narrowing -MMD -flto -mmcu=atmega4809 -DF_CPU=16000000L -DARDUINO=10809 -DARDUINO_AVR_NANO_EVERY main.cpp -o main.o\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-g++ -w -Os -g -flto -fuse-linker-plugin -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--section-start=.text=0x0 -mmcu=atmega4809 -o main.elf main.o\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O binary -R .eeprom main.elf main.bin\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O ihex -j .eeprom --set-section-flags=.eeprom=alloc,load --no-change-warnings --change-section-lma .eeprom=0 main.elf main.eep\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O ihex -R .eeprom main.elf main.hex\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-size -C main.elf\n```\n\nThis mostly comes from the Arduino IDE's console output window.\nI've made only very small modifications.\nThe `upload` rule is also taken from the Arduino IDE:\n\n```makefile\nupload:\n    python3 ./reset.py ${PORT}\n    ${AVRDUDE} -C${CONFDIR} -v -patmega4809 -cjtag2updi -P${PORT} -b115200 -e -D -Uflash:w:main.hex:i -Ufuse2:w:0x01:m -Ufuse5:w:0xC9:m -Ufuse8:w:0x00:m\n```\n\nThere is one subtle thing here.\nIf we check the Arduino IDE's console output, we can read the following message: `Forcing reset using 1200 bps open/close on port /dev/ttyACM0`.\nThis means that we need to reset the Arduino before avrdude starts uploading the program.\nI found that the more reliable way to do that is to use a little python3 script:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport sys\nimport serial\n\ncom = serial.Serial(sys.argv[1], 1200)\ncom.dtr=False\ncom.close()\n```\n\nFinally, we need a `clean` rule that removes all the compiled files.\nThis is a pretty easy rule to write, so I'll just throw the whole makefile there:\n\n```makefile\nBIN_DIR?=${AVR_TOOLS_DIR}/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin\nAVRDUDE_DIR?=${AVR_TOOLS_DIR}/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/\nAVRDUDE?=${AVRDUDE_DIR}/bin/avrdude\nCONFDIR?=${AVRDUDE_DIR}/etc/avrdude.conf\n\nPORT?=/dev/ttyACM0\n\nall:\n

-DF_CPU=16000000L -DARDUINO=10809 -DARDUINO_AVR_NANO_EVERY main.cpp -o main.o\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-g++ -w -Os -g -flto -fuse-linker-plugin -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--section-start=.text=0x0

main.bin main.d main.eep main.elf main.hex main.o\n```\n\nThere we are, all that's left is to put this in a `Makefile`file.\nNow we can type `make` to compile the code and `make upload` to upload it to the board.\n\n## Example: Blink the On-board LED\n\nWe are going to go through a very simple example: the LED blink example.\n\n### Arduino Version\n\nHere's the Arduino code for the LED blink example:\n\n```cpp\nconst int ledPin = 13;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // set the LED on\n  delay(1000);                  // wait for a second\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // set the LED off\n  delay(1000);                  // wait for a second\n}\n```\n\nUsing the Arduino IDE to compile this code, we get the following message:\n\n```text\nSketch uses 1118 bytes (2%) of program storage space. Maximum is 49152 bytes.\nGlobal variables use 22 bytes (0%) of dynamic memory, leaving 6122 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 6144 bytes.\n```\n\nSo, in order to make a LED blink every second, we need 1118 bytes of program space, and 22 bytes of RAM.\nTo me, that sounds like a lot!\n\n### C Version\n\nNow let's go low-level and see what we can do without using the Arduino library.\nSince we're using a C++ compiler, it's not really C code, but it looks like it is:\n\n```cpp\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <util/delay.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00); // Disable prescaler\n\n    PORTE.DIRSET |= PIN2_bm;\n\n    for(;;)\n    {\n        _delay_ms(1000);\n        PORTE.OUTTGL |= PIN2_bm;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe first line of the main function is used to disable the prescaler, which ensures that the CPU runs at the wanted 16MHz frequency.\nIf you check out the Arduino Nano Every connector pinouts, you'll see that the on-board LED is connected to `D13`.\nThis pin is also labeled `SCK` and `PE2`.\nThe latter tells us that this particular pin is wired to port E, pin 2.\nAnd that's all we need for our LED blink example.\nFirst we use the `DIRSET` register of port E to set the pin 2 bit, which will set pin 2 as an output.\nThen, in the main for loop, we write the pin 2 bit into the `OUTTGL` register, which toggles the state of pin 2.\nIn between each toggling, we use the `_delay_ms` function, which allows us to wait for a given time.\n\nThe ports registers and pins definitions are provided by the `avr/io.h` header which contains everything we need.\nBecause we passed the `-mmcu=atmega4809` flag to avr-gcc in our makefile, it knows that we are using an ATMega4809.\nThe `_delay_ms` function comes from `util/delay.h`, it needs to know the CPU clock frequency, which why we passed to avr-gcc using `-DF_CPU=16000000L`.\n\nThis program does the same thing as the previous one, except it uses a lot less memory and needs no RAM:\n\n```text\nAVR Memory Usage\n----------------\nDevice: Unknown\n\nProgram:     238 bytes\n(.text + .data + .bootloader)\n\nData:          0 bytes\n(.data + .bss + .noinit)\n```\n\n### C++ Version\n\nOkay, so I'm not a big fan of C, and I wonder if we could make this code more readable.\nI would like to be able to write something like `led.Toggle()` instead of `PORTE.OUTTGL |= PIN2_bm`.\n\nIn order to be as generic as possible, we are going to define a class that allows pin manipulation.\nOne more thing: I really don't like pointers, so we are going to try to avoid them at all cost.\n\nFirst of all, we need to know how `PORTE` is defined.\nIts definition lies in the `avr/include/avr/iom4809.h` file: `#define PORTE                (*(PORT_t *) 0x0480) /* I/O Ports */`, where `PORT_t` is a big struct with a bunch of `register_t` in it.\nFort instance, `OUTTGL` and `DIRSET` are in that struct.\nAnd here's where it gets kind of ugly: `typedef volatile uint8_t register8_t;`.\nEvery `register8_t` is declared as volatile, which makes sense because our LED blink wouldn't work otherwise (the compiler would optimize away the `PORTE.OUTTGL |= PIN2_bm` line).\n\nSo, the first thing that we need, is the address of `PORTE`.\nBecause of that `volatile` keyword, we can't use `constexpr` nor `static_cast`, so we are going to define it as: `static const auto PORTE_ADDR = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t>(&PORTE);`.\nNote that this is a 16-bit address\n\nNow we define a pin as a port and a pin number.\nIn our case: port E (its address) and pin 2 (its bit mask).\nThese two things are known at compile time, so we can use them as template parameters.\nHence, we are going to define a `Pin` class that take these two parameters as template parameters:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace DigitalIO\n{\n\n    static const auto PORTE_ADDR = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t>(&PORTE);\n\n    template <uint16_t portAddr, uint8_t mask>\n    class Pin\n    {\n    public:\n        Pin() = delete;\n        ~Pin() = delete;\n\n        static constexpr void ConfigureAsInput()\n        {\n            port().DIRSET &= ~mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr void ConfigureAsOutput()\n        {\n            port().DIRSET |= mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr void Toggle()\n        {\n            port().OUTTGL |= mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr void SetHigh()\n        {\n            port().OUTSET |= mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr void SetLow()\n        {\n            port().OUTCLR |= mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr auto& port()\n        {\n            return *reinterpret_cast<PORT_t*>(portAddr);\n        }\n        \n    private:\n\n    };\n    \n} // namespace IO\n```\n\nWe need to cast the port address back to a `PORT_t` struct, which is the role of the `port()` function.\nThe rest of the code is pretty straightforward, we encapsulate our C code into `static` methods.\n\nHere's how to use this code:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"DigitalIO.h\"\n\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <util/delay.h>\n\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nusing Led = DigitalIO::Pin<DigitalIO::PORTE_ADDR, PIN2_bm>;\n\nint main()\n{\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00); // Disable prescaler\n\n    Led::ConfigureAsOutput();\n\n    for(;;)\n    {\n        _delay_ms(1000);\n        Led::Toggle();\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIt looks almost the same as the previous code, except that it's a bit more readable.\n\nBut we did add quite a bit of boilerplate code in our `DigitalIO.h` file, is that a good idea?\nI believe it is. Right now, we don't see how this can be very useful because our program is small and basic.\nWith a bigger code base, I think it would be way easier to understand our code with a well-structured C++ program.\n\nBut wait a minute, isn't all that code going to add more bytes to our program?\nLet's check that, shall we?\n\n```text\nAVR Memory Usage\n----------------\nDevice: Unknown\n\nProgram:     238 bytes\n(.text + .data + .bootloader)\n\nData:          0 bytes\n(.data + .bss + .noinit)\n```\n\nIt doesn't. In fact the assembly code is exactly the same as the previous one.\nWhy is that? Because gcc is awesome, of course!\nSo, we can write C++ code and get the same assembly code as a C program, that's what we call *zero cost abstraction*.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nOkay, so we've seen how to program an Arduino Nano Every without using the Arduino library.\nThrough a very simple example, we've also seen that C and C++ code lead to the same assembly code.\n\nIn the next part, we will focus on MIDI and see how we can turn our Arduino Nano Every into a MIDI device.\n","excerpt":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This is a series of posts.

If you haven't read the previous part here's a link to it: [New Arduino Nano Every Trigger Board - Part 1](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part1).\nIn this part, I'm going to describe how to compile C++ code and upload it to the Arduino Nano Every without using the Arduino library.\n\nBut why would one want to do that, you may ask?\nThe answer is simple: the Arduino library does a lot of things that may impact performance.\nFor instance, some interrupts are being fired frequently, and slow things down.\n\nLet's be honest, we're not going to reinvent the wheel, most of what we are going to do here is to use the Arduino IDE's compiler and tools.\nSay we install the Arduino IDE (version 1.8.9) and compile a program.\nHere's what we're going to see:\n\n![image](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/arduino-ide.png)\n\nThe interesting part is the console, where all the compilation-related messages are shown.\nWe see that the IDE uses avr-gcc version 7.3.0, along with a few other tools.\nLet's see what we can do with that.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nFirst of all, we can see *where* all these tools are located.\nA little digging reveals that an environment variable named *AVR_TOOLS_DIR* contains the tools folder location.\nThus, we can type the following: `$AVR_TOOLS_DIR/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin/avr-gcc --version` and execute the command in a terminal.\nThis will print the avr-gcc version.\n\n## Makefile for the Arduino Nano Every\n\nThis is not a tutorial about makefiles, if you want an in-depth tutorial about makefiles, please read the official [GNU Make Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/).\nWith that out of the way, let's write a makefile.\n\n### Variables\n\nFirst of all, we need to define some variables.\nHaving the avr-gcc bin directory as variable seems like a good idea, so we define the following: `BIN_DIR?=${AVR_TOOLS_DIR}/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin`.\nYour bin directory may differ, so be sure to check its correct location.\nThat's the only variable we'll need for the compiling process.\n\nThere's one more thing that we need in order to upload the compiled program to the Arduino, though.\nThis thing is avrdude.\nIt's a little bit trickier, as we need the avrdude executable and a configuration file.\nSo here are our variables:\n\n```makefile\nAVRDUDE_DIR?=${AVR_TOOLS_DIR}/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/\nAVRDUDE?=${AVRDUDE_DIR}/bin/avrdude\nCONFDIR?=${AVRDUDE_DIR}/etc/avrdude.conf\n```\n\nAgain, be sure to check the the executable path.\nIf you want to provide your own configuration file, you can use the following (sorry, it isn't a short snippet...):\n\n```ini\n\n#------------------------------------------------------------\n# AVR8X family common values\n#------------------------------------------------------------\n\npart\n    id

the Arduino IDE (in the *tools* menu).\n\n### Rules\n\nNow that we have defined all the variables that we need, we have to create some rules to compile and upload our code to the Arduino.\nTo that end, we are going to have three rules: `all`, to compile the code, `upload`, to upload the binary to the board, and `clean` to remove all the build files.\n\nLet's start with the `all` rule:\n\n```makefile\nall:\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-g++ -c -g -Os -w -std=c++17 -fpermissive -fno-exceptions -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fno-threadsafe-statics -Wno-error=narrowing -MMD -flto -mmcu=atmega4809 -DF_CPU=16000000L -DARDUINO=10809 -DARDUINO_AVR_NANO_EVERY main.cpp -o main.o\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-g++ -w -Os -g -flto -fuse-linker-plugin -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--section-start=.text=0x0 -mmcu=atmega4809 -o main.elf main.o\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O binary -R .eeprom main.elf main.bin\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O ihex -j .eeprom --set-section-flags=.eeprom=alloc,load --no-change-warnings --change-section-lma .eeprom=0 main.elf main.eep\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O ihex -R .eeprom main.elf main.hex\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-size -C main.elf\n```\n\nThis mostly comes from the Arduino IDE's console output window.\nI've made only very small modifications.\nThe `upload` rule is also taken from the Arduino IDE:\n\n```makefile\nupload:\n    python3 ./reset.py ${PORT}\n    ${AVRDUDE} -C${CONFDIR} -v -patmega4809 -cjtag2updi -P${PORT} -b115200 -e -D -Uflash:w:main.hex:i -Ufuse2:w:0x01:m -Ufuse5:w:0xC9:m -Ufuse8:w:0x00:m\n```\n\nThere is one subtle thing here.\nIf we check the Arduino IDE's console output, we can read the following message: `Forcing reset using 1200 bps open/close on port /dev/ttyACM0`.\nThis means that we need to reset the Arduino before avrdude starts uploading the program.\nI found that the more reliable way to do that is to use a little python3 script:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport sys\nimport serial\n\ncom = serial.Serial(sys.argv[1], 1200)\ncom.dtr=False\ncom.close()\n```\n\nFinally, we need a `clean` rule that removes all the compiled files.\nThis is a pretty easy rule to write, so I'll just throw the whole makefile there:\n\n```makefile\nBIN_DIR?=${AVR_TOOLS_DIR}/avr-gcc/7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5/bin\nAVRDUDE_DIR?=${AVR_TOOLS_DIR}/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/\nAVRDUDE?=${AVRDUDE_DIR}/bin/avrdude\nCONFDIR?=${AVRDUDE_DIR}/etc/avrdude.conf\n\nPORT?=/dev/ttyACM0\n\nall:\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-g++ -c -g -Os -w -std=c++17 -fpermissive -fno-exceptions -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fno-threadsafe-statics -Wno-error=narrowing -MMD -flto -mmcu=atmega4809 -DF_CPU=16000000L -DARDUINO=10809 -DARDUINO_AVR_NANO_EVERY main.cpp -o main.o\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-g++ -w -Os -g -flto -fuse-linker-plugin -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--section-start=.text=0x0 -mmcu=atmega4809 -o main.elf main.o\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O binary -R .eeprom main.elf main.bin\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O ihex -j .eeprom --set-section-flags=.eeprom=alloc,load --no-change-warnings --change-section-lma .eeprom=0 main.elf main.eep\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-objcopy -O ihex -R .eeprom main.elf main.hex\n    ${BIN_DIR}/avr-size -C main.elf\n\n\nupload:\n    python3 ./reset.py ${PORT}\n    ${AVRDUDE} -C${CONFDIR} -v -patmega4809 -cjtag2updi -P${PORT} -b115200 -e -D -Uflash:w:main.hex:i -Ufuse2:w:0x01:m -Ufuse5:w:0xC9:m -Ufuse8:w:0x00:m\n\n\nclean:\n    rm -f main.bin main.d main.eep main.elf main.hex main.o\n```\n\nThere we are, all that's left is to put this in a `Makefile`file.\nNow we can type `make` to compile the code and `make upload` to upload it to the board.\n\n## Example: Blink the On-board LED\n\nWe are going to go through a very simple example: the LED blink example.\n\n### Arduino Version\n\nHere's the Arduino code for the LED blink example:\n\n```cpp\nconst int ledPin = 13;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // set the LED on\n  delay(1000);                  // wait for a second\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // set the LED off\n  delay(1000);                  // wait for a second\n}\n```\n\nUsing the Arduino IDE to compile this code, we get the following message:\n\n```text\nSketch uses 1118 bytes (2%) of program storage space. Maximum is 49152 bytes.\nGlobal variables use 22 bytes (0%) of dynamic memory, leaving 6122 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 6144 bytes.\n```\n\nSo, in order to make a LED blink every second, we need 1118 bytes of program space, and 22 bytes of RAM.\nTo me, that sounds like a lot!\n\n### C Version\n\nNow let's go low-level and see what we can do without using the Arduino library.\nSince we're using a C++ compiler, it's not really C code, but it looks like it is:\n\n```cpp\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <util/delay.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00); // Disable prescaler\n\n    PORTE.DIRSET |= PIN2_bm;\n\n    for(;;)\n    {\n        _delay_ms(1000);\n        PORTE.OUTTGL |= PIN2_bm;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe first line of the main function is used to disable the prescaler, which ensures that the CPU runs at the wanted 16MHz frequency.\nIf you check out the Arduino Nano Every connector pinouts, you'll see that the on-board LED is connected to `D13`.\nThis pin is also labeled `SCK` and `PE2`.\nThe latter tells us that this particular pin is wired to port E, pin 2.\nAnd that's all we need for our LED blink example.\nFirst we use the `DIRSET` register of port E to set the pin 2 bit, which will set pin 2 as an output.\nThen, in the main for loop, we write the pin 2 bit into the `OUTTGL` register, which toggles the state of pin 2.\nIn between each toggling, we use the `_delay_ms` function, which allows us to wait for a given time.\n\nThe ports registers and pins definitions are provided by the `avr/io.h` header which contains everything we need.\nBecause we passed the `-mmcu=atmega4809` flag to avr-gcc in our makefile, it knows that we are using an ATMega4809.\nThe `_delay_ms` function comes from `util/delay.h`, it needs to know the CPU clock frequency, which why we passed to avr-gcc using `-DF_CPU=16000000L`.\n\nThis program does the same thing as the previous one, except it uses a lot less memory and needs no RAM:\n\n```text\nAVR Memory Usage\n----------------\nDevice: Unknown\n\nProgram:     238 bytes\n(.text + .data + .bootloader)\n\nData:          0 bytes\n(.data + .bss + .noinit)\n```\n\n### C++ Version\n\nOkay, so I'm not a big fan of C, and I wonder if we could make this code more readable.\nI would like to be able to write something like `led.Toggle()` instead of `PORTE.OUTTGL |= PIN2_bm`.\n\nIn order to be as generic as possible, we are going to define a class that allows pin manipulation.\nOne more thing: I really don't like pointers, so we are going to try to avoid them at all cost.\n\nFirst of all, we need to know how `PORTE` is defined.\nIts definition lies in the `avr/include/avr/iom4809.h` file: `#define PORTE                (*(PORT_t *) 0x0480) /* I/O Ports */`, where `PORT_t` is a big struct with a bunch of `register_t` in it.\nFort instance, `OUTTGL` and `DIRSET` are in that struct.\nAnd here's where it gets kind of ugly: `typedef volatile uint8_t register8_t;`.\nEvery `register8_t` is declared as volatile, which makes sense because our LED blink wouldn't work otherwise (the compiler would optimize away the `PORTE.OUTTGL |= PIN2_bm` line).\n\nSo, the first thing that we need, is the address of `PORTE`.\nBecause of that `volatile` keyword, we can't use `constexpr` nor `static_cast`, so we are going to define it as: `static const auto PORTE_ADDR = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t>(&PORTE);`.\nNote that this is a 16-bit address\n\nNow we define a pin as a port and a pin number.\nIn our case: port E (its address) and pin 2 (its bit mask).\nThese two things are known at compile time, so we can use them as template parameters.\nHence, we are going to define a `Pin` class that take these two parameters as template parameters:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace DigitalIO\n{\n\n    static const auto PORTE_ADDR = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t>(&PORTE);\n\n    template <uint16_t portAddr, uint8_t mask>\n    class Pin\n    {\n    public:\n        Pin() = delete;\n        ~Pin() = delete;\n\n        static constexpr void ConfigureAsInput()\n        {\n            port().DIRSET &= ~mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr void ConfigureAsOutput()\n        {\n            port().DIRSET |= mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr void Toggle()\n        {\n            port().OUTTGL |= mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr void SetHigh()\n        {\n            port().OUTSET |= mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr void SetLow()\n        {\n            port().OUTCLR |= mask;\n        }\n\n        static constexpr auto& port()\n        {\n            return *reinterpret_cast<PORT_t*>(portAddr);\n        }\n        \n    private:\n\n    };\n    \n} // namespace IO\n```\n\nWe need to cast the port address back to a `PORT_t` struct, which is the role of the `port()` function.\nThe rest of the code is pretty straightforward, we encapsulate our C code into `static` methods.\n\nHere's how to use this code:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"DigitalIO.h\"\n\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <util/delay.h>\n\n#include <stdint.h>\n\nusing Led = DigitalIO::Pin<DigitalIO::PORTE_ADDR, PIN2_bm>;\n\nint main()\n{\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00); // Disable prescaler\n\n    Led::ConfigureAsOutput();\n\n    for(;;)\n    {\n        _delay_ms(1000);\n        Led::Toggle();\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIt looks almost the same as the previous code, except that it's a bit more readable.\n\nBut we did add quite a bit of boilerplate code in our `DigitalIO.h` file, is that a good idea?\nI believe it is. Right now, we don't see how this can be very useful because our program is small and basic.\nWith a bigger code base, I think it would be way easier to understand our code with a well-structured C++ program.\n\nBut wait a minute, isn't all that code going to add more bytes to our program?\nLet's check that, shall we?\n\n```text\nAVR Memory Usage\n----------------\nDevice: Unknown\n\nProgram:     238 bytes\n(.text + .data + .bootloader)\n\nData:          0 bytes\n(.data + .bss + .noinit)\n```\n\nIt doesn't. In fact the assembly code is exactly the same as the previous one.\nWhy is that? Because gcc is awesome, of course!\nSo, we can write C++ code and get the same assembly code as a C program, that's what we call *zero cost abstraction*.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nOkay, so we've seen how to program an Arduino Nano Every without using the Arduino library.\nThrough a very simple example, we've also seen that C and C++ code lead to the same assembly code.\n\nIn the next part, we will focus on MIDI and see how we can turn our Arduino Nano Every into a MIDI device.\n","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1672680453526},"$loki":7},{"slug":"new-arduino-nano-every-board-part3","description":"This is a series of posts.

If you haven't read the previous part here's a link to it: [New Arduino Nano Every Trigger Board - Part 2](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part2).\n\nIn this part, we are going to send MIDI notes over USB using the Arduino Nano Every.\nTo understand everything correctly, make sure you read the previous parts.\n\n♬ ♪ ♬ ♪\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## MIDI Protocol for a Basic Drum Module\n\nFirst, we are going to talk about MIDI and what it actually is at the \"hardware\" level.\nI'll be honest, I probably know only the basis of MIDI.\nHowever, I believe I know enough to make a drum module that sends MIDI notes and messages.\n\nFor a basic drum module, we'll need two MIDI ingredients: notes and control change.\nMIDI is old, so most messages are represented by bytes, that is values that can go from 0 to 255, or -128 to 127 if you represent byte as signed integers using two's complement.\nBut there's a catch, MIDI doesn't always use 8-bit data, rather, some parameters use 7-bit data, so their values go from 0 to 127.\nThat means, there are 128 MIDI notes.\n\nSo what is a MIDI (drum) note exactly?\nWell, drums are a bit different than other instruments in a sense that there aren't actual notes per say.\nThere is one thing called *Universal General MIDI Drum Notes* that saves us, though.\nIt defines more than 40 \"notes\" (from note 35 to 81) that [represent drum instruments](https://www.zendrum.com/resource-site/drumnotes.htm).\nHere are some examples: 35 is *Acoustic Bass Drum*, 38 is *Acoustic Snare*, 70 is *Maracas*, and 81 is *Open Triangle*.\n\n### MIDI Commands\n\nIn practice, MIDI notes are sent using commands. There are two note commands: *Note On* and *Note Off*.\nAs the names suggest, the former tells the instrument to play a note, and the latter says that we need to stop playing that note.\nA command, such as *Note On*, is represented by a byte.\nThis byte is divided into two distinct parts: the command itself, and the MIDI channel.\nThere are 16 MIDI channels, so in theory you can send 16 *Note On* commands over the 16 available channels.\n\nThe way it works is that the command byte is cut in half. The most significant bits represent the command, and the least significant bits represent the channel number.\nHere's an example. We would like to send a *Note On* command over channel 0.\nThe command number for *Note On* is 144, so we simply send a byte that holds the value 144, easy.\nBut, in MIDI, drums use channel 10, so how do we send a note over channel 10?\n\nTo answer that question, we are going to use hexadecimal values instead of decimal.\nThe *Note On* command for channel 0 is 144, which becomes `0x90` in hexadecimal.\nChannel number 10, becomes channel number `0x09` (because they are numbered from 0!), so a *Note On* command over channel 10 is `0x99`.\nBy the way `0x99` is 153 in decimal, so that's just `144 + 9`, which is the *Note On* command *plus* the channel number (with the first channel being numbered as 0).\n\n### Drum Notes\n\nNow, we know how to send a *Note On* command. It is quite simple, as only one byte needs to be sent.\nThis byte value is `0x99` in hexadecimal if we use channel 10.\n\nIf a MIDI instrument were to received that command, it would need to know which note to play.\nThis is why the *Note On* command must be followed by the note number.\nLets say we want a snare drum sound, we need to send `0x99` followed by 38, or `0x26`.\n\nAnd that's it. If an instrument receives those two bytes one after another it will know that it should play a snare drum note.\nBut it won't, because there's still one thing that's missing here: the velocity.\n\n### Note Velocity\n\nIt would be no fun at all if all the notes had the same velocity.\nThat's why a third byte follows the MIDI command and MIDI note number, and that third byte represents the velocity.\nThe velocity goes from 0 to 127 (yes it uses only 7 bits).\n\nFinally, to send a snare drum note with a velocity of 92, we have to send 3 bytes: `154, 38, 92` or, in hexadecimal: `0x99, 0x26, 0x5C`.\n\n### Baud Rate & Latency\n\nYou probably think that sending only 3 bytes must be very fast, but is it really that fast?\nMIDI communications usually happen at 38400 bauds per second.\nThe actual speed in bytes per seconds is 38400 divided by 8, which gives 4800 Bps.\nSay we send 3 bytes per note, that gives us 1600 notes per second, or 0.625 milliseconds (ms) to send a note.\nThat may not seem like a lot, and it isn't really a lot, but that's getting close to 1 ms.\n\nDo we really have to stick with 38400 bps?\nI believe we don't, but it depends on the VST (Virtual Studio Technology) you use.\nNow, if we use a baud rate of 115200 bps, we get 14400 Bps, so 4800 notes per second.\nThat means we're sending one note in nearly 0.2 ms. That's a bit better.\n\n### Control Change\n\nOkay, it's quite easy to understand what a note is, but perhaps we need a little bit more than that.\nWith MIDI notes, we can have a drum kit that's made of pads.\nEvery time we hit a pad, we send a note whose velocity is proportional to the pad's volume.\nWe can have drums and cymbals, but how do we deal with the hi-hat controller?\n\nWe could vary the note number according to the pedal's openness.\nAfter all, there are two notes dedicated to the hi-hat: 42 is *Closed Hi-Hat* and 46 *Open Hi-Hat*, and some VSTs also define a *Semi-Open Hi-Hat* note.\nThat's a totally fine thing to do, but there's a better solution: control change.\n\nControl change may seem more complicated than note commands, but it really is based on the same principle: send 3 bytes.\nThe first byte is the command byte, and it is 176 or `0xB0` in hexadecimal.\nAs for the notes, it has to be combined with the channel number.\nSo for channel 10, we get 186 or `0xBA`.\n\nThe second byte represents the control function.

If you haven't read the previous part here's a link to it: [New Arduino Nano Every Trigger Board - Part 2](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part2).\n\nIn this part, we are going to send MIDI notes over USB using the Arduino Nano Every.\nTo understand everything correctly, make sure you read the previous parts.\n\n♬ ♪ ♬ ♪\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## MIDI Protocol for a Basic Drum Module\n\nFirst, we are going to talk about MIDI and what it actually is at the \"hardware\" level.\nI'll be honest, I probably know only the basis of MIDI.\nHowever, I believe I know enough to make a drum module that sends MIDI notes and messages.\n\nFor a basic drum module, we'll need two MIDI ingredients: notes and control change.\nMIDI is old, so most messages are represented by bytes, that is values that can go from 0 to 255, or -128 to 127 if you represent byte as signed integers using two's complement.\nBut there's a catch, MIDI doesn't always use 8-bit data, rather, some parameters use 7-bit data, so their values go from 0 to 127.\nThat means, there are 128 MIDI notes.\n\nSo what is a MIDI (drum) note exactly?\nWell, drums are a bit different than other instruments in a sense that there aren't actual notes per say.\nThere is one thing called *Universal General MIDI Drum Notes* that saves us, though.\nIt defines more than 40 \"notes\" (from note 35 to 81) that [represent drum instruments](https://www.zendrum.com/resource-site/drumnotes.htm).\nHere are some examples: 35 is *Acoustic Bass Drum*, 38 is *Acoustic Snare*, 70 is *Maracas*, and 81 is *Open Triangle*.\n\n### MIDI Commands\n\nIn practice, MIDI notes are sent using commands. There are two note commands: *Note On* and *Note Off*.\nAs the names suggest, the former tells the instrument to play a note, and the latter says that we need to stop playing that note.\nA command, such as *Note On*, is represented by a byte.\nThis byte is divided into two distinct parts: the command itself, and the MIDI channel.\nThere are 16 MIDI channels, so in theory you can send 16 *Note On* commands over the 16 available channels.\n\nThe way it works is that the command byte is cut in half. The most significant bits represent the command, and the least significant bits represent the channel number.\nHere's an example. We would like to send a *Note On* command over channel 0.\nThe command number for *Note On* is 144, so we simply send a byte that holds the value 144, easy.\nBut, in MIDI, drums use channel 10, so how do we send a note over channel 10?\n\nTo answer that question, we are going to use hexadecimal values instead of decimal.\nThe *Note On* command for channel 0 is 144, which becomes `0x90` in hexadecimal.\nChannel number 10, becomes channel number `0x09` (because they are numbered from 0!), so a *Note On* command over channel 10 is `0x99`.\nBy the way `0x99` is 153 in decimal, so that's just `144 + 9`, which is the *Note On* command *plus* the channel number (with the first channel being numbered as 0).\n\n### Drum Notes\n\nNow, we know how to send a *Note On* command. It is quite simple, as only one byte needs to be sent.\nThis byte value is `0x99` in hexadecimal if we use channel 10.\n\nIf a MIDI instrument were to received that command, it would need to know which note to play.\nThis is why the *Note On* command must be followed by the note number.\nLets say we want a snare drum sound, we need to send `0x99` followed by 38, or `0x26`.\n\nAnd that's it. If an instrument receives those two bytes one after another it will know that it should play a snare drum note.\nBut it won't, because there's still one thing that's missing here: the velocity.\n\n### Note Velocity\n\nIt would be no fun at all if all the notes had the same velocity.\nThat's why a third byte follows the MIDI command and MIDI note number, and that third byte represents the velocity.\nThe velocity goes from 0 to 127 (yes it uses only 7 bits).\n\nFinally, to send a snare drum note with a velocity of 92, we have to send 3 bytes: `154, 38, 92` or, in hexadecimal: `0x99, 0x26, 0x5C`.\n\n### Baud Rate & Latency\n\nYou probably think that sending only 3 bytes must be very fast, but is it really that fast?\nMIDI communications usually happen at 38400 bauds per second.\nThe actual speed in bytes per seconds is 38400 divided by 8, which gives 4800 Bps.\nSay we send 3 bytes per note, that gives us 1600 notes per second, or 0.625 milliseconds (ms) to send a note.\nThat may not seem like a lot, and it isn't really a lot, but that's getting close to 1 ms.\n\nDo we really have to stick with 38400 bps?\nI believe we don't, but it depends on the VST (Virtual Studio Technology) you use.\nNow, if we use a baud rate of 115200 bps, we get 14400 Bps, so 4800 notes per second.\nThat means we're sending one note in nearly 0.2 ms. That's a bit better.\n\n### Control Change\n\nOkay, it's quite easy to understand what a note is, but perhaps we need a little bit more than that.\nWith MIDI notes, we can have a drum kit that's made of pads.\nEvery time we hit a pad, we send a note whose velocity is proportional to the pad's volume.\nWe can have drums and cymbals, but how do we deal with the hi-hat controller?\n\nWe could vary the note number according to the pedal's openness.\nAfter all, there are two notes dedicated to the hi-hat: 42 is *Closed Hi-Hat* and 46 *Open Hi-Hat*, and some VSTs also define a *Semi-Open Hi-Hat* note.\nThat's a totally fine thing to do, but there's a better solution: control change.\n\nControl change may seem more complicated than note commands, but it really is based on the same principle: send 3 bytes.\nThe first byte is the command byte, and it is 176 or `0xB0` in hexadecimal.\nAs for the notes, it has to be combined with the channel number.\nSo for channel 10, we get 186 or `0xBA`.\n\nThe second byte represents the control function. It can be a modulation wheel, a foot controller, an expression controller, etc.\nThere are 128 possible control functions, but some of them are undefined.\nFor the hi-hat controller, the one we are interested in is the *foot controller*, so control function number 4.\nThe second byte is 4, `0x04`.\n\nNow the third byte is the value the control function should take.\nJust like the velocity, this value goes from 0 to 127.\n\nIf the hi-hat pedal is half-open, we send the following three bytes: `186, 4, 63`, or `0xBA, 0x04, 0x3F`.\nAt least that what we send when a control change message needs to be sent. But when do we send a control change exactly?\n\nTwo options come to mind: when the sensor register a change that's big enough to be perceptible, or at regular time interval.\nWe'll go for the former, as there's no reason to send a control change if there's no change in the sensor value.\n\n## Serial MIDI Over USB\n\nSo far we've talked about MIDI as bytes we send to a device, but we need to address how we send those bytes.\n\n### The Hard Truth About the ATMega4809\n\nThe ATMega4809 has 4 USART (universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter) preipherals.\nOne of them is accessible via the Arduino Nano Every board pins `RX` and `TX`, and the other one is hardwired to another microcontroller that's on the board: the SAMD11D14A.\n\nWhy is there another microcontroller on the board?

break;\n        }\n\n        usart().BAUD = BaudRate(br);\n        usart().CTRLB |= USART_RXEN_bm | USART_TXEN_bm; \n        usart().CTRLC |= USART_CMODE_ASYNCHRONOUS_gc | USART_PMODE_DISABLED_gc;\n    }\n\n    constexpr void SendByte(uint8_t c)\n    {\n        while(!(usart().STATUS & USART_DREIF_bm))\n        {\n            ;\n        }        \n        usart().TXDATAL = c;\n    }\n\n    static constexpr uint16_t BaudRate(uint32_t baudRate)\n    {\n        return static_cast<uint16_t>(static_cast<float>((F_CPU * 64 / (16 * static_cast<float>(baudRate))) + 0.5));\n    }\n\n    static constexpr USART_t& usart()\n    {\n        switch(N)\n        {\n            case 0: return USART0;\n            case 1: return USART1;\n            case 2: return USART2;\n            case 3: return USART3;\n            default: static_assert(N <= 3, \"Invalid USART number.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private:\n\n    };\n\n} // namespace IO\n```\n\nYou'll notice that there is a `SendByte` function.\nThat's all we need to send MIDI notes, as we need to send 3 bytes for each `Note On` command.\n\n## Sending MIDI Over USART\n\nAll right, lets wring some code that sends MIDI notes.\nWe are going to use one more little helper:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"DigitalIO/Usart.hpp\"\n\ntemplate <typename Usart>   \nclass SerialMidi\n{\n\npublic:\n\n    SerialMidi() = delete;\n    ~SerialMidi() = default;\n\n    SerialMidi(Usart& usart) : usart_{usart}\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    template <uint8_t channel>\n    inline void NoteOn(uint8_t note, uint8_t velocity) const noexcept\n    {\n        usart_.SendByte(0x90 | (channel & 0x0f));\n        usart_.SendByte(note);\n        usart_.SendByte(velocity);\n    }\n\n    template <uint8_t channel, uint8_t control>\n    inline void ControlChange(uint8_t value) const noexcept\n    {\n        static_assert(control <= 127, \"Invalid control value.\");\n        usart_.SendByte(0xB0 | (channel & 0x0f));\n        usart_.SendByte(control);\n        usart_.SendByte(value);\n    }\n\n\nprivate:\n\n    Usart& usart_;\n\n};\n```\n\nEven if we are not going to use it, I included the `ControlChange` function.\n\n```cpp\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <avr/interrupt.h>\n#include <util/delay.h>\n\nusing Usart3 = DigitalIO::Usart<3>;\n\nstatic Usart3 usart{115'200};\nstatic SerialMidi midi{usart};\n\nint main()\n{\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00); // Disable prescaler\n\n    sei();\n\n    const uint8_t snareNote = 38;\n    const uint8_t bdNote = 36;\n    const uint8_t hhNote = 42;\n\n    const uint8_t nbNotes = 8;\n    const uint8_t snareNotes[nbNotes] =    {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0};\n    const uint8_t hihatNotes[nbNotes] =    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1};\n    const uint8_t bassDrumNotes[nbNotes] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0};\n\n    uint8_t i = 0;\n\n    for(;;)\n    {\n        _delay_ms(400);\n\n        if(snareNotes[i] == 1)\n        {\n            midi.NoteOn<9>(snareNote, 80);\n        }\n\n        if(hihatNotes[i] == 1)\n        {\n            midi.NoteOn<9>(hhNote, 80);\n        }\n\n        if(bassDrumNotes[i] == 1)\n        {\n            midi.NoteOn<9>(bdNote, 80);\n        }\n\n        i = ++i % nbNotes;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWe have defined three instruments: a snare drum, a hi-hat, and a bass drum, each having its MIDI note: 38, 42 and 36, respectively.\nWe also define an array of eight notes for each instrument.\nIn that array, a \"1\" means that the instrument's note is to be played, and a \"0\" means nothing happens.\nWe iterate the array in loop, and play a note every 400 ms.\nI believe the code is self-explanatory.\n\n## Playing Those Notes\n\nAs I have already mentioned, our Arduino isn't recognized as a MIDI device because it doesn't use the USB protocol.\nConsequently, we need to *convert* the incoming serial data to MIDI data.\nTo that end, we can use [ttymidi](https://github.com/cjbarnes18/ttymidi).\nIt isn't too hard to use, and works well on Linux.\nFirst of all, we need to clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cjbarnes18/ttymidi`.\nThen, in the `ttymidi` directory, we need to compile it using `make`.\nAnd finally, to start the program, we run the following command:\n\n```text\n./ttymidi -s /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 -v\n```\n\nWhere `/dev/ttyACM0` is the Arduino's serial port.\nLet ttymidi run with the Arduino plugged in and you'll see MIDI notes being received in real-time.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nWe are going to take a break for now.\nI don't when the next part will be posted, but I know it'll be about the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).\nWe'll probably get back to MIDI-related topics another time.\nSee you next time!\n","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1672680453578},"$loki":8},{"slug":"new-arduino-nano-every-board-part5","description":"This is a series of posts.

Using eXaDrums or a PC loaded with a VST, it allows to play drums with a very low latency.\nThe board itself is called *eXaDrums TB08-SE*, and it is compatible with other microcontrollers than the Arduino Nano Every.\n\nHere's a brief reminder of the specs I gave in the first part of this series of articles:\n\n- Works on PC and Raspberry Pi.\n- Up to 7 single-zone pads + 1 hi-hat controller.\n- Compatible with Roland TD-9, TD-11, TD-15, TD-17, TD-25, and TD-27-based edrum kits (DB25 connector).\n- Sample rate greater than 70ksps (kilo samples per second).\n- Nearly 9000 samples per second and per channel (8928 in average).\n- Configurable trigger parameters: threshold, scan time and mask time (1ms step).\n- Configurable MIDI channel and notes.\n\nThe last two are still under development.\n\n## How to Get the Board?\n\nI designed a board and got 5 prototypes PCBs.\nHowever, that board requires some refinements. I would like to make some changes before I share the whole PCB so that it is as good as it can be.\nMeanwhile, you can easily replicate the schematics, as it is a quite simple circuit.\nEvery piezo is wired to a single operational amplifier that acts as a simple amplifier that adds a bias voltage to the signal.\nHere's how it looks:\n\n![Circuit](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/Piezo-circuit.png)\n\nThe `Vcc` voltage is taken from the Arduino's 5V `power out` (pin number 12).\nAt the `Vbias` pin, the voltage is 1.65V.\nIt is obtained by using a voltage divider made of two 10k resistors that are wired to the 3.3V `power out` pin of the Arduino (pin number 2).\n\nThe hi-hat controller input is a little different, and simpler.\nIt consists of a single 4.7k resistor wired to the 3.3V pin of the Arduino on one side, and the hi-hat controller as well as the `+` input of voltage follower. It is the same divider for all operational amplifiers.\n\nAnd that's it, you know everything. There are 4 dual operational amplifiers on the board, which makes a total of 8 inputs.\nI got my prototypes from JLCPCB, using their SMT sevice, which means that I received assembled boards, that is, all the components were already soldered, except for the Raspberry Pi GPIO header socket.\nIf you'd like to get you own board, I do recommend JLCPCB, the PCBs are good quality and affordable, the only downside is the shipping cost.\nOr, if you're patient, you can wait until I'm done with improving the board's layout, it shouldn't take too long.\nAgain, I just want to make the best board possible, which will require a few changes.\n\n## Where is the Code?\n\nThe code is freely available at [GitHub](https://github.com/SpintroniK/exadrumino-Nano-Every).\nYou'll find more details as well as instructions that will help you flash the code to your Arduino.\nNote that the code is still a work in progress, some features are not their yet.\nThe most important missing features are those that allow to change trigger and MIDI parameters via the USART, and save those parameters to the on-board EEPROM.\n\n## Previous and Next Parts\n\nSo far there has been 4 parts published in this series of articles. This is the fifth one.\nHere's a reminder of the previous parts and what they talk about:\n\n- [Part 1](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part1): New board specs, and how it works.\n- [Part 2](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part2): Makefile and the way C++ has been used to write the firmware.\n- [Part 3](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part3): Sending serial MIDI notes over USB.\n- [Part 4](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part4): How to use the ADC to make an oscilloscope and read triggers voltages.\n\nThere will be at least two more parts which will deal with the following topics:\n\n- [Part 6](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part6): How to get an efficient real-time counter.\n- [Part 7](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part7): How to filter the piezo output signal very fast to make a drum trigger.\n- Part 8: How to read and write values to the on-board EEPROM.\n- Maybe more...\n\nSee you next time!\n","excerpt":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This is a series of posts.

If you haven't read the previous part here's a link to it: [New Arduino Nano Every Trigger Board - Part 3](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part3).\n\nIn this part, we are going to read data from the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and make an oscilloscope.\nIt'll show us what the piezo voltage of drum pad looks like when hit with a drum stick.\n\n![signal](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/signal.png)\n\nTo understand everything correctly, make sure you read the previous parts.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## How the ADC Works\n\nThis part is going to be a little bit more theoretical.\nBut we'll see a concrete example at the end.\n\n### ADC Configuration\n\nFirst of all, we need to talk about the ATMega4809's ADC configuration.\nWithout going into the very technical details, I'll talk about some of the important parameters of the ADC.\nIt needs a clock source, which can be obtained from the peripheral clock.\nThe way this clock signal is generated, is by dividing the CPU clock by a 'divider' that goes from 2 to 256.\nSince the CPU clock is 16 MHz, that leaves with an ADC frequency that goes from 62.5 kHz to 8 MHz.\nIn practice, it is recommended to avoid low frequencies, and to not go above 1.5 MHz.\nA normal conversion takes 13 ADC clock cycles, so the fastest conversion time we can get is 8.67 µs.\nThat is a bit over 115 kilo samples per seconds (ksps).\n\nAnother important parameter is the resolution of the ADC. Here we have two choices: 8-bit or 10-bit.\nIn the case of 8-bit sampling, we can store the data into a single byte.\nHowever, 10-bit resolution will require 16-bit integers to store the results, which can lead to slower code.\n\nThere are different modes of operation. We are interested in the 'normal' mode, in which we ask the microcontroller to start a new conversion ourselves. There's also the free-running mode, in which the ADC starts a new conversion every time the previous one has finished.\n\n### Events and Interrupts\n\nThere are two ways the microcontroller can communicate with peripherals:\n\n- Interrupts: they let you execute a function automatically after an hardware event has occurred.\n- Events: they allow peripherals to communicate with one another.\n\nWe are going to use both of them, the event will trigger a new conversion when a timer overflows, and the interrupt will be used to fetch the conversion result.\n\n## Using the ADC in C++\n\nFirst, let's see how to use the ADC in C++.\nWe define a few useful things: \n\n```cpp\nstatic const auto Adc0Addr = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t>(&ADC0);\n\nclass Adc10bitType;\nclass Adc8bitType;\n\nenum class Vref : uint8_t\n{\n    External,\n    Internal, \n    Vdd,\n};\n\nenum class Prescaler : uint8_t\n{\n    Div2,\n    Div4,\n    Div8,\n    Div16,\n    Div32,\n    Div64,\n    Div128,\n    Div256\n};\n\ntemplate <typename T, typename Enable = void>\nclass AdcBase;\n\ntemplate <typename T>\nclass AdcBase<T, Util::enable_if_t<Util::is_same_v<T, Adc8bitType>>>\n{\npublic:\n    AdcBase() = delete;\n    ~AdcBase() = delete;\n\nprotected:\n\n    inline static uint8_t value{};\n\n};\n\n\ntemplate <typename T>\nclass AdcBase<T, Util::enable_if_t<Util::is_same_v<T, Adc10bitType>>>\n{\npublic:\n    AdcBase() = delete;\n    ~AdcBase() = delete;\n\nprotected:\n\n    inline static uint16_t value{};\n\n};\n```\n\nThe ADC register's address is stored in `Adc0Addr`.\nWe've defined utilities for the ADC resolution, its voltage reference, and the frequency divider.\n\nNotice the use of `enable_if`, which is defined as:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace Util\n{\n    \n    template <class T, T v>\n    struct integral_constant \n    {\n        static constexpr T value = v;\n        using value_type = T;\n        using type = integral_constant; // using injected-class-name\n        constexpr operator value_type() const noexcept { return value; }\n        constexpr value_type operator()() const noexcept { return value; } // since c++14\n    };\n\n    template <class T, class U>\n    struct is_same : integral_constant<bool, false> {};\n    \n    template <class T>\n    struct is_same<T, T> : integral_constant<bool, true> {};\n\n    template<bool B, class T = void>\n    struct enable_if {};\n    \n    template<class T>\n    struct enable_if<true, T> { using type = T; };\n\n    template< bool B, class T = void >\n    using enable_if_t = typename enable_if<B,T>::type;\n\n    template< class T, class U >\n    inline constexpr bool is_same_v = is_same<T, U>::value;\n\n} // namespace Util\n```\n\nThis is usually part of the standard C++ library, but we don't have it, so these definitions help us achieve what we need: two different types for the 8-bit and 10-bit modes.\nAlright, now we're done with the boilerplate, so let's get all the basic stuff out of the way:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <uint16_t addr, typename ValueType>\nclass Adc : private AdcBase<ValueType>\n{\n\npublic:\n\n    Adc() = delete;\n    ~Adc() = delete;\n\n    template <Prescaler div>\n    static constexpr void SetPrescaler()\n    {\n        switch(div)\n        {\n            case Prescaler::Div2:   adc().CTRLC |= ADC_PRESC_DIV2_gc; break;\n            case Prescaler::Div4:   adc().CTRLC |= ADC_PRESC_DIV4_gc; break;\n            case Prescaler::Div8:   adc().CTRLC |= ADC_PRESC_DIV8_gc; break;\n            case Prescaler::Div16:  adc().CTRLC |= ADC_PRESC_DIV16_gc;

            // 14 µs\n\nTca::SetClockDivider<Timing::TCAClockDiv::Div16>();\nTca::Enable();\n```\n\nThe complete code will be on [GitHub](https://github.com/SpintroniK/exadrumino-Nano-Every) soon.\nI believe the code speaks for itself: the timer will overflow every 14 µs.\nIt will count up to 13 (including 0), at a frequency of 1 MHz (CPU clock divided by 16).\n\n### Event System\n\nLet's see how we can trigger an ADC conversion automatically when the timer overflows.\nTo that end, we are going to use the ATMega4809's event system.\nThe event system has 8 channels that allows peripherals to communicate with each other.\nEach channel can be used to connect a peripheral to another one, or itself.\nWe are interested in the overflow event of the TCA timer and the ADC conversion start event.\n\nBut first let's use a little helper that'll make our life easier and the code more readable: \n\n```cpp\n#include <avr/io.h>\n\n#include <stdint.h>\n\ninline constexpr uint8_t EVSYS_GENERATOR_TCA0_OVF_gc = 0x80 << 0; // Should already be defined, but it's not...\n\nnamespace Event\n{\n\n    using Generator = uint8_t;\n    using Event = register8_t;\n\n\n    class EventSystem\n    {\n        \n    public:\n        EventSystem() = delete;\n        ~EventSystem() = delete;\n\n        template <uint8_t channel>\n        static constexpr void Connect(Generator in, Event& out)\n        {\n            switch(channel)\n            {\n                case 0:\n                {\n                    EVSYS.CHANNEL0 = in;\n                    out = EVSYS_CHANNEL_CHANNEL0_gc;\n                    break;\n                }\n\n                case 1:\n                {\n                    EVSYS.CHANNEL1 = in;\n                    out = EVSYS_CHANNEL_CHANNEL1_gc;\n                    break;\n                }\n\n                default: static_assert(channel <= 7, \"\"); break;\n            }\n        }\n\n    private:\n\n    };\n    \n} // namespace Event\n```\n\nI've only implemented the code for channel 0 and channel 1. Other channels can be added by filling the switch-case statement.\nAnd that's how we 'connect' the TCA's overflow to the ADC's start conversion event:\n\n```cpp\nEvent::EventSystem::Connect<0>(EVSYS_GENERATOR_TCA0_OVF_gc, EVSYS.USERADC0);\n```\n\n## ADC Events and Interrupts\n\nA few things are missing in our ADC class.\nWe need to be able to enable events and interrupts, so we can add the following member functions:\n\n```cpp\nstatic constexpr void EnableInterrupts()\n{\n    adc().INTCTRL |= ADC_RESRDY_bm;\n}\n\nstatic constexpr void EnableEvents()\n{\n    adc().EVCTRL |= ADC_STARTEI_bm;\n}\n```\n\nThat's it for the event's configuration, but what about the interrupt?\nAn interrupt is triggered by the hardware, but it needs to be handled on the software side.\nMore precisely, we need to define a function that is going to be called when an interrupt is fired.\nIt is kind of a callback function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.\n\nI'm not going to go into the gory details of gcc, but because of a bug in the compiler, with have to define a new class with a static function that handles the interrupt:\n\n```cpp\nclass AdcInterrupts\n{\npublic:\n\n    AdcInterrupts() = delete;\n    ~AdcInterrupts() = delete;\n\nprivate:\n\n    static void ResReady() __asm__(\"__vector_22\") __attribute__((__signal__, __used__, __externally_visible__));\n};\n```\n\nWe can handle some other ADC interrupts in the same class if we need to.\nBut how do we know that we need to use the vector 22?\nAgain without going into a lot of details, the answer is in the `iom4809.h` header, where we can find:\n\n```cpp\n/* ADC0 interrupt vectors */\n#define ADC0_RESRDY_vect_num  22\n#define ADC0_RESRDY_vect      _VECTOR(22)  /*  */\n#define ADC0_WCOMP_vect_num  23\n#define ADC0_WCOMP_vect      _VECTOR(23)  /*  */\n```\n\n## Putting it All Together\n\nOkay, now we have almost everything we need, so it's time to write our main function.\nBut before that, we need to define the body of our ADC interrupt in a `.cpp` file.\nLet's put it in our `main.cpp` file then:\n\n```cpp\n\nusing Adc0 = Adc<Adc0Addr, Adc8bitType>;\n\nvoid Analog::AdcInterrupts::ResReady()\n{\n    Adc0::ResetInterrupt();\n    // Do somehing with the ADC value ADC0.RES here\n}\n```\n\nWhat we do with the resulting value is up to us, as long as our computations finish before the timer overflows again.\n\nNow to our main function.\n\n```cpp\nint main()\n{\n\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00); // Disable prescaler\n\n    sei();\n\n    Event::EventSystem::Connect<0>(EVSYS_GENERATOR_TCA0_OVF_gc, EVSYS.USERADC0);\n\n    // Configure ADC\n    Adc0::EnableInterrupts();\n    Adc0::EnableEvents();\n    Adc0::SelectChannel(ADC_MUXPOS_AIN0_gc);\n    Adc0::SetPrescaler<Analog::Prescaler::Div8>();\n    Adc0::SetReference<Analog::Vref::External>();\n    Adc0::Enable();\n\n    // Configure TCA\n    Tca::SetSingleMode<Timing::TCASingleMode::Normal>();\n    Tca::DisableEventCounting();\n    Tca::SetPeriod(13);             // 14 µs\n    \n    Tca::SetClockDivider<Timing::TCAClockDiv::Div16>();\n    Tca::Enable();\n\n\n\n    for(;;)\n    {\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nFirst of all, we disable the CPU clock prescaler.\nThen, we enable interrupts, and we connect the TCA overflow event to the ADC start conversion event.\nWe configure the ADC and the TCA.\nAnd finally, we write an infinite loop.\nOur ADC is sampling `AIN0` but, so far, we're not doing anything with the result.\n\n## Arduino Nano Every Oscilloscope\n\nIn this last section, we are going to use everything that has been presented above, plus the previous part of this series of articles.\nSo if you haven't read the [previous part](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part3), I encourage you to do so.\n\n### Retrieve the ADC Value\n\nWe are going to need a variable to store the ADC value.\nAs this variable will be accessed by both the ADC interrupt and our main function, we ought to declare it as a global variable.\n\n```cpp\n\nusing Adc0 = Adc<Adc0Addr, Adc8bitType>;\n\nstatic uint8_t adcValue{};\n\nvoid Analog::AdcInterrupts::ResReady()\n{\n    Adc0::ResetInterrupt();\n    adcValue = ADC0.RES;\n}\n```\n\n### Send ADC Values Over the USART\n\nWe're going to use the USART code that we wrote in the previous part of this series.\nThe last thing we need to do is to is be able to send strings over the USART.\nIn the previous part, we wrote a function that allowed us to send a single byte.\nA string is an array of characters, and every character can be represented as a single byte.\nAll we need is to format the string and send the bytes it is made of.\nUsing `string.h` this isn't too hard to achieve.\n\n```cpp\n#include \"Adc.hpp\"\n#include \"Usart.hpp\"\n\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <avr/interrupt.h>\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n\nusing Adc0 = Adc<Adc0Addr, Adc8bitType>;\nusing Tca = TCA<TCASingle>;\n\nstatic uint8_t adcValue{};\n\nstatic DigitalIO::Usart<3> usart{115'200};\n\nvoid Analog::AdcInterrupts::ResReady()\n{\n    Adc0::ResetInterrupt();\n    adcValue = ADC0.RES;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00);

Here we have two choices: 8-bit or 10-bit.\nIn the case of 8-bit sampling, we can store the data into a single byte.\nHowever, 10-bit resolution will require 16-bit integers to store the results, which can lead to slower code.\n\nThere are different modes of operation. We are interested in the 'normal' mode, in which we ask the microcontroller to start a new conversion ourselves. There's also the free-running mode, in which the ADC starts a new conversion every time the previous one has finished.\n\n### Events and Interrupts\n\nThere are two ways the microcontroller can communicate with peripherals:\n\n- Interrupts: they let you execute a function automatically after an hardware event has occurred.\n- Events: they allow peripherals to communicate with one another.\n\nWe are going to use both of them, the event will trigger a new conversion when a timer overflows, and the interrupt will be used to fetch the conversion result.\n\n## Using the ADC in C++\n\nFirst, let's see how to use the ADC in C++.\nWe define a few useful things: \n\n```cpp\nstatic const auto Adc0Addr = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t>(&ADC0);\n\nclass Adc10bitType;\nclass Adc8bitType;\n\nenum class Vref : uint8_t\n{\n    External,\n    Internal, \n    Vdd,\n};\n\nenum class Prescaler : uint8_t\n{\n    Div2,\n    Div4,\n    Div8,\n    Div16,\n    Div32,\n    Div64,\n    Div128,\n    Div256\n};\n\ntemplate <typename T, typename Enable = void>\nclass AdcBase;\n\ntemplate <typename T>\nclass AdcBase<T, Util::enable_if_t<Util::is_same_v<T, Adc8bitType>>>\n{\npublic:\n    AdcBase() = delete;\n    ~AdcBase() = delete;\n\nprotected:\n\n    inline static uint8_t value{};\n\n};\n\n\ntemplate <typename T>\nclass AdcBase<T, Util::enable_if_t<Util::is_same_v<T, Adc10bitType>>>\n{\npublic:\n    AdcBase() = delete;\n    ~AdcBase() = delete;\n\nprotected:\n\n    inline static uint16_t value{};\n\n};\n```\n\nThe ADC register's address is stored in `Adc0Addr`.\nWe've defined utilities for the ADC resolution, its voltage reference, and the frequency divider.\n\nNotice the use of `enable_if`, which is defined as:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace Util\n{\n    \n    template <class T, T v>\n    struct integral_constant \n    {\n        static constexpr T value = v;\n        using value_type = T;\n        using type = integral_constant; // using injected-class-name\n        constexpr operator value_type() const noexcept { return value; }\n        constexpr value_type operator()() const noexcept { return value; } // since c++14\n    };\n\n    template <class T, class U>\n    struct is_same : integral_constant<bool, false> {};\n    \n    template <class T>\n    struct is_same<T, T> : integral_constant<bool, true> {};\n\n    template<bool B, class T = void>\n    struct enable_if {};\n    \n    template<class T>\n    struct enable_if<true, T> { using type = T; };\n\n    template< bool B, class T = void >\n    using enable_if_t = typename enable_if<B,T>::type;\n\n    template< class T, class U >\n    inline constexpr bool is_same_v = is_same<T, U>::value;\n\n} // namespace Util\n```\n\nThis is usually part of the standard C++ library, but we don't have it, so these definitions help us achieve what we need: two different types for the 8-bit and 10-bit modes.\nAlright, now we're done with the boilerplate, so let's get all the basic stuff out of the way:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <uint16_t addr, typename ValueType>\nclass Adc : private AdcBase<ValueType>\n{\n\npublic:\n\n    Adc() = delete;\n    ~Adc() = delete;\n\n    template <Prescaler div>\n    static constexpr void SetPrescaler()\n    {\n        switch(div)\n        {\n            case Prescaler::Div2:   adc().CTRLC |= ADC_PRESC_DIV2_gc;

            // 14 µs\n\nTca::SetClockDivider<Timing::TCAClockDiv::Div16>();\nTca::Enable();\n```\n\nThe complete code will be on [GitHub](https://github.com/SpintroniK/exadrumino-Nano-Every) soon.\nI believe the code speaks for itself: the timer will overflow every 14 µs.\nIt will count up to 13 (including 0), at a frequency of 1 MHz (CPU clock divided by 16).\n\n### Event System\n\nLet's see how we can trigger an ADC conversion automatically when the timer overflows.\nTo that end, we are going to use the ATMega4809's event system.\nThe event system has 8 channels that allows peripherals to communicate with each other.\nEach channel can be used to connect a peripheral to another one, or itself.\nWe are interested in the overflow event of the TCA timer and the ADC conversion start event.\n\nBut first let's use a little helper that'll make our life easier and the code more readable: \n\n```cpp\n#include <avr/io.h>\n\n#include <stdint.h>\n\ninline constexpr uint8_t EVSYS_GENERATOR_TCA0_OVF_gc = 0x80 << 0; // Should already be defined, but it's not...\n\nnamespace Event\n{\n\n    using Generator = uint8_t;\n    using Event = register8_t;\n\n\n    class EventSystem\n    {\n        \n    public:\n        EventSystem() = delete;\n        ~EventSystem() = delete;\n\n        template <uint8_t channel>\n        static constexpr void Connect(Generator in, Event& out)\n        {\n            switch(channel)\n            {\n                case 0:\n                {\n                    EVSYS.CHANNEL0 = in;\n                    out = EVSYS_CHANNEL_CHANNEL0_gc;\n                    break;\n                }\n\n                case 1:\n                {\n                    EVSYS.CHANNEL1 = in;\n                    out = EVSYS_CHANNEL_CHANNEL1_gc;\n                    break;\n                }\n\n                default: static_assert(channel <= 7, \"\"); break;\n            }\n        }\n\n    private:\n\n    };\n    \n} // namespace Event\n```\n\nI've only implemented the code for channel 0 and channel 1. Other channels can be added by filling the switch-case statement.\nAnd that's how we 'connect' the TCA's overflow to the ADC's start conversion event:\n\n```cpp\nEvent::EventSystem::Connect<0>(EVSYS_GENERATOR_TCA0_OVF_gc, EVSYS.USERADC0);\n```\n\n## ADC Events and Interrupts\n\nA few things are missing in our ADC class.\nWe need to be able to enable events and interrupts, so we can add the following member functions:\n\n```cpp\nstatic constexpr void EnableInterrupts()\n{\n    adc().INTCTRL |= ADC_RESRDY_bm;\n}\n\nstatic constexpr void EnableEvents()\n{\n    adc().EVCTRL |= ADC_STARTEI_bm;\n}\n```\n\nThat's it for the event's configuration, but what about the interrupt?\nAn interrupt is triggered by the hardware, but it needs to be handled on the software side.\nMore precisely, we need to define a function that is going to be called when an interrupt is fired.\nIt is kind of a callback function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.\n\nI'm not going to go into the gory details of gcc, but because of a bug in the compiler, with have to define a new class with a static function that handles the interrupt:\n\n```cpp\nclass AdcInterrupts\n{\npublic:\n\n    AdcInterrupts() = delete;\n    ~AdcInterrupts() = delete;\n\nprivate:\n\n    static void ResReady() __asm__(\"__vector_22\") __attribute__((__signal__, __used__, __externally_visible__));\n};\n```\n\nWe can handle some other ADC interrupts in the same class if we need to.\nBut how do we know that we need to use the vector 22?\nAgain without going into a lot of details, the answer is in the `iom4809.h` header, where we can find:\n\n```cpp\n/* ADC0 interrupt vectors */\n#define ADC0_RESRDY_vect_num  22\n#define ADC0_RESRDY_vect      _VECTOR(22)  /*  */\n#define ADC0_WCOMP_vect_num  23\n#define ADC0_WCOMP_vect      _VECTOR(23)  /*  */\n```\n\n## Putting it All Together\n\nOkay, now we have almost everything we need, so it's time to write our main function.\nBut before that, we need to define the body of our ADC interrupt in a `.cpp` file.\nLet's put it in our `main.cpp` file then:\n\n```cpp\n\nusing Adc0 = Adc<Adc0Addr, Adc8bitType>;\n\nvoid Analog::AdcInterrupts::ResReady()\n{\n    Adc0::ResetInterrupt();\n    // Do somehing with the ADC value ADC0.RES here\n}\n```\n\nWhat we do with the resulting value is up to us, as long as our computations finish before the timer overflows again.\n\nNow to our main function.\n\n```cpp\nint main()\n{\n\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00); // Disable prescaler\n\n    sei();\n\n    Event::EventSystem::Connect<0>(EVSYS_GENERATOR_TCA0_OVF_gc, EVSYS.USERADC0);\n\n    // Configure ADC\n    Adc0::EnableInterrupts();\n    Adc0::EnableEvents();\n    Adc0::SelectChannel(ADC_MUXPOS_AIN0_gc);\n    Adc0::SetPrescaler<Analog::Prescaler::Div8>();\n    Adc0::SetReference<Analog::Vref::External>();\n    Adc0::Enable();\n\n    // Configure TCA\n    Tca::SetSingleMode<Timing::TCASingleMode::Normal>();\n    Tca::DisableEventCounting();\n    Tca::SetPeriod(13);             // 14 µs\n    \n    Tca::SetClockDivider<Timing::TCAClockDiv::Div16>();\n    Tca::Enable();\n\n\n\n    for(;;)\n    {\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nFirst of all, we disable the CPU clock prescaler.\nThen, we enable interrupts, and we connect the TCA overflow event to the ADC start conversion event.\nWe configure the ADC and the TCA.\nAnd finally, we write an infinite loop.\nOur ADC is sampling `AIN0` but, so far, we're not doing anything with the result.\n\n## Arduino Nano Every Oscilloscope\n\nIn this last section, we are going to use everything that has been presented above, plus the previous part of this series of articles.\nSo if you haven't read the [previous part](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part3), I encourage you to do so.\n\n### Retrieve the ADC Value\n\nWe are going to need a variable to store the ADC value.\nAs this variable will be accessed by both the ADC interrupt and our main function, we ought to declare it as a global variable.\n\n```cpp\n\nusing Adc0 = Adc<Adc0Addr, Adc8bitType>;\n\nstatic uint8_t adcValue{};\n\nvoid Analog::AdcInterrupts::ResReady()\n{\n    Adc0::ResetInterrupt();\n    adcValue = ADC0.RES;\n}\n```\n\n### Send ADC Values Over the USART\n\nWe're going to use the USART code that we wrote in the previous part of this series.\nThe last thing we need to do is to is be able to send strings over the USART.\nIn the previous part, we wrote a function that allowed us to send a single byte.\nA string is an array of characters, and every character can be represented as a single byte.\nAll we need is to format the string and send the bytes it is made of.\nUsing `string.h` this isn't too hard to achieve.\n\n```cpp\n#include \"Adc.hpp\"\n#include \"Usart.hpp\"\n\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <avr/interrupt.h>\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n\nusing Adc0 = Adc<Adc0Addr, Adc8bitType>;\nusing Tca = TCA<TCASingle>;\n\nstatic uint8_t adcValue{};\n\nstatic DigitalIO::Usart<3> usart{115'200};\n\nvoid Analog::AdcInterrupts::ResReady()\n{\n    Adc0::ResetInterrupt();\n    adcValue = ADC0.RES;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n\n    _PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL_MCLKCTRLB, 0x00); // Disable prescaler\n\n    sei();\n\n    Event::EventSystem::Connect<0>(EVSYS_GENERATOR_TCA0_OVF_gc, EVSYS.USERADC0);\n\n    // Configure ADC\n    Adc0::EnableInterrupts();\n    Adc0::EnableEvents();\n    Adc0::SelectChannel(ADC_MUXPOS_AIN2_gc);\n    Adc0::SetPrescaler<Analog::Prescaler::Div8>();\n    Adc0::SetReference<Analog::Vref::External>();\n    Adc0::Enable();\n\n    // Configure TCA\n    Tca::SetSingleMode<Timing::TCASingleMode::Normal>();\n    Tca::DisableEventCounting();\n    Tca::SetPeriod(13);             // 14 µs\n    \n    Tca::SetClockDivider<Timing::TCAClockDiv::Div16>();\n    Tca::Enable();\n\n    for(;;)\n    {\n        // brain.SendMidiNotes();\n        static char str[32];\n        ::sprintf(str, \"%d\\n\", adcValue);\n\n        for(uint8_t i = 0; i < ::strlen(str); ++i)\n        {\n            usart.SendByte(str[i]);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n\nAnd here we are, we have an Arduino Nano Every oscilloscope.\nYou can use the [new exadrums Arduino Nano Every board](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part3) to connect your e-drums to and have look at a piezo signal in real time, for instance the snare drum.\n\n![arduino-board](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/board-arduino.png)\n\nThen, you can launch the Arduino IDE, and hit Ctrl + Shift + L.\nYou'll see something like that if you play flams, for instance:\n\n![oscilloscope](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/oscilloscope.png)\n\nYou'll notice that we are getting one new sample every 14 µs, but sending data at a baudrate of 115200 bps, which corresponds to about 5000 values per second in average.\nWe are getting samples way to fast, but that's not really a problem since this is just a step towards our goal: making a drum module.\nSo getting one sample every 14 µs means we can aim for 8928 samples per second and per piezo if we use 8 piezos.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nNext time I'll share the code, as it is now usable and I've tested it with my Roland TD17 e-drum.\nStay tuned!\n","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1672680453643},"$loki":10},{"slug":"new-arduino-nano-every-board-part6","description":"This is a series of posts.

If you haven't read the previous part here's a link to it: [New Arduino Nano Every Trigger Board - Part 5](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part5).\n\nIn this part, we are going to talk about real-time counters.\nIn particular, we'll see advantages of using a relative time reference.\n\nAnd we'll also see how the following figure helps us measure a time difference efficiently using a single byte as our time reference!\n\n![delta](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/delta.png)\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Absolute and Relative Time Reference\n\nThe first important thing that we need to know is that we can't have an absolute time reference.\nBecause our time reference needs to store the time in a variable, it will overflow at some point.\nThat means, an absolute time reference remains absolute as long as the counter variable doesn't overflow.\n\nThis is a major drawback, especially for limited hardware, where incrementing a 32-bit variable can be very expensive.\nAn 8-bit microcontroller such as the ATMega4809 isn't able to increment a 32-bit variable in a single instruction.\nSo, to avoid overflows, we need to either decrease the resolution of our counter, or store its value into a bigger variable.\nBut, this won't prevent the counter from overflowing at some point anyway... So what can we do about that?\n\nHere's an example to illustrate our problem.\nSay we want to increment a counter every microsecond.\nWe are playing drums an hour or two every day, and we'd like our time reference to be absolute.\n\nLet's say we want to store our counter value in a 32-bit integer.\nThat leaves us with 4295 seconds before the counter overflows, which is slightly more than an hour.\nWe have three solutions:\n\n- Use a 64-bit variable, which will cause an overflow after a few billion years.\n- Increase the resolution of our timer to, say 1 ms, so that we get nearly 50 days before the variable overflows.\n- Work with a relative time reference instead of an absolute one.\n\nAll three options work, but we are interested in the latter, as this will allow us to store our count in a 16-bit, possibly a 8-bit variable.\n\nA relative time reference is a single variable that is incremented at regular interval.\nThe only difference with an absolute time reference is that we know it will overflow at some point, and that's not a problem.\n\n## Relative Time Reference\n\n### How it Works\n\nContrary to the absolute time reference, the relative time reference needs to be compared to another variable.\nFor instance, if a drum pad is hit, we get the value of our relative time reference (counter) and memorize it.\nAfter some time, we are going to check how much time has elapsed since we've memorized the time reference value.\n\n### Practical Example\n\nFirst of all, we need to state the requirements for our time reference.\nWe'd like to make a drum module, so the time reference will be used to manage the triggers states.\nThat includes the trig time, scan time, and mask time.\nFor those values, it would be nice to have a resolution of 0.1 or 0.5 ms, something like that.\nHowever, I will choose a step of 1 ms.\nThe main reason for that, is that 0.1 ms is too small and 0.5 ms could lead to confusion...\n\nLet's say we use a 8-bit variable for our counter.\nIt is incremented every millisecond, so it can count from zero to 255 ms.\nAnd it does so continuously until it overflows and goes back to zero.\n\nNow if a drum pad is hit, the trigger registers the current value of the counter.\nImagine that the value of the counter is 42. It is stored in a `trigTime` variable.\nWe set the scan time to 4 ms, which means the scan time will be done when the counter reaches 46.\nThe only thing we need to know is: is the counter greater or equal to 46.\n\nA problem arises if the counter overflows, though.\nLet's say the pad has been hit when the counter's value was 254.\nWe'll know that the scan time is over when the counter's value will be greater or equal to 258.\nBut our 8-bit variable will overflow before that, so we'll get the following sequence: 254, 255, 0, 1, 2, instead of 254, 255, 256, 257, 258.\n\nFortunately, we can do something about that.\nInstead of using unsigned integers, we can use signed integers, but we're going to go over a few other details before we do so.\nWe still use a 8-bit unsigned integer to store our counter's value, so it can go from 0 to 255.\nWe do the same for our scan time variable.\nIn order to determine if we have waited for a longer time than the scan time here's what we need to compute: `const uint8_t delta = trigTime + scanTime - currentTime;`.\n\nSo far, we still use an unsigned integer, but, let's examine precisely what happens with the previous values.\nWe have `trigTime = 254` and `scanTime = 4`.\nHere's what happens if we subtract the `currentTime` variable to the previous value:\n\n1. If `currentTime = 255` we get `delta =  254 + 4 - 255 = 3`.\n2. If `currentTime` overflows, for instance, `currentTime = 1`, we get `delta =  254 + 4 - 1 = 1`.\n3. If `currentTime` overflows, and we've waited longer than the scan time, for instance, `currentTime = 4`, we get `delta = 254 + 4 - 4 = 254`.\n\n### A Little Bit of Theory\n\nNow let's see what happens for a different value of `trigTime`: `trigTime = 120`, and consider a longer scanTime: `scanTime = 100`.\n\n1. If `currentTime = 128` we get `delta =  120 + 100 - 128 = 92`.\n2. If `currentTime` doesn't overflow, for instance, `currentTime = 200`, we get `delta =  120 + 100 - 200 = 20`.\n3. If `currentTime` doesn't overflow, and we've waited longer than the scan time, for instance, `currentTime = 240`, we get `delta = 120 + 100 - 240 = 236`.\n\nWe see something interesting here, for cases 1 and 2, delta remains below 127, but in both cases, point number 3 gives us a value that is above 128.\nThis is understandable, because if `currentTime >= trigTime + scanTime`, `deltat = rigTime + scanTime - currentTime` goes below zero.\nBut with unsigned integers, that means `delta` is now 255 minus something, so we get 254 or 236 in the second third case.\nNotice how the result is the same whether the value overflows or not!\n\nWhat that means is that perhaps we should treat `delta` as a signed integer.\nIt's important to note that, even if we treat `delta` as a signed integer, the underlying binary value of `delta` remains the same.\n\nA signed 8-bit integer goes from -128 to 127. The most significant bit, or MSB, determines the sign.\nIf that bit is set to 1, the value is negative, otherwise, it is positive.\nSo, if we count from zero, the value goes like this: 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 126, 127, -128, -127, -126, ..., -3, -2, -1.\nWhich is to be compared to a unsigned integer that goes like: 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, ..., 253, 254, 255.\nBoth sequences are different representations of the same binary value.\n\nThis means that `delta` is negative if the elapsed time since the trig time is longer than the scan time.\nBack to our first example, but this time using the signed representation of delta:\n\n1. If `currentTime = 255` we get `delta =  254 + 4 - 255 = 3`.\n2. If `currentTime` overflows, for instance, `currentTime = 2`, we get `delta =  254 + 4 - 2 = 0`.\n3. If `currentTime` overflows, and we've waited longer than the scan time, for instance, `currentTime = 4`, we get `delta = 254 + 4 - 4 = -2`.\n\nWe have the following three cases:\n\n- If we have waited less than the scan time duration, the value is positive.\n- If we have waited exactly the duration of the scan time, the value is zero.\n- If we have waited more than the scan time duration, the value is negative.\n\nLet's visualize what's happening here.\n\n![delta](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/delta.png)\n\nThe value of `delta` reaches 0 when the elapsed time since the trig time is exactly the scan time.\nFor an unsigned integer, the next value is 255, and if we cast `delta` to a signed integer, it is -1.\nThere are a few options to detect the transition:\n\n- We could simply test if the unsigned representation of `delta` is greater or equal to 128.\n- We could test the MSB of the unsigned representation of `delta`.\n- Or we could cast `delta` to a signed integer an check if the value is negative.\n\nI like the latter the most because it gives us a useful information for free: the elapsed time since the end of the scan time.\nThat time is equal to `-delta`.\nHowever, there's one thing that I didn't mention: we loose half of the values of our 8-bit integer.\nAll three options above lead to the same result, we can now only measure time differences that go from 0 to 128ms.\n\nIf you'd like a to read a slightly different explanation of this idea, please read the [following article from Lucky Resistor](https://luckyresistor.me/2019/07/10/real-time-counter-and-integer-overflow/).\n\n## Using TCB0 as a Real Time Counter\n\nWe are already using the TCA counter to trigger the ADC conversions, so we are going to use the TCB0 timer/counter instead.\n\n### Configure TCB0 and Handle Interrupts\n\nThe TCB timer/counter can do a lot of things, but we're only going to use it as a counter here.\nFirst of all, we define a class to handle the counters interrupts:\n\n```cpp\nclass TCBInterrupts\n{\n\npublic:\n    TCBInterrupts() = delete;\n    ~TCBInterrupts() = delete;\n\nprivate:\n\n    static void TCB0Overflow() __asm__(\"__vector_12\") __attribute__((__signal__, __used__, __externally_visible__));\n    static void TCB1Overflow() __asm__(\"__vector_13\") __attribute__((__signal__, __used__, __externally_visible__));\n\n};\n```\n\nAnd yes, \"counters\" with an \"s\", as there are 4 TCB timers.\nNote that I implemented the interrupts for TCB0 and TCB1 only.\n\nNow let's add a little helper to choose the right clock for TCB0:\n\n```cpp\nenum class TCBClock\n{\n    Div1,\n    Div2,\n    TCA\n};\n```\n\nWe'll use the same clock as TCA.\nAnd now a class to configure the TCB counters:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <uint8_t nb>\nclass TCB\n{\n\npublic:\n    TCB() = delete;\n    ~TCB() = delete;\n\n    static constexpr void EnableInterrupts()\n    {\n        tcb().INTCTRL =  TCB_CAPT_bm;\n    }\n\n    static constexpr void ResetInterrupt()\n    {\n        tcb().INTFLAGS |= TCB_CAPT_bm;\n    }\n\n    static constexpr void SetCompareOrCapture(uint16_t value)\n    {\n        tcb().CCMP = value;\n    }\n\n    static constexpr void Enable()\n    {\n        tcb().CTRLA |= TCB_ENABLE_bm;\n    }\n\n    template <TCBClock clock>\n    static constexpr void SetClock()\n    {\n        switch(clock)\n        {\n            case TCBClock::Div1: tcb().CTRLA |= TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV1_gc; break;\n            case TCBClock::Div2: tcb().CTRLA |= TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV2_gc; break;\n            case TCBClock::TCA: tcb().CTRLA |= TCB_CLKSEL_CLKTCA_gc; break;\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n\n    static constexpr auto& tcb()\n    {\n        switch(nb)\n        {\n            case 0: return TCB0;\n            case 1: return TCB1;\n            case 2: return TCB2;\n            case 3: return TCB3;\n            default: static_assert(nb <= 3, \"Wrong TCB number.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n};\n\n```\n\nThe functions names are self-explanatory.\n\n### A Real-Time Counter\n\nBefore we continue, we need one more ingredient: a counter.\nTo that end, I'll make a class template that will allow to choose the type of variable that the counter uses.\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename T>\nclass Counter\n{     \n\npublic:\n\n    Counter() = default;\n    ~Counter() = default;\n\n    constexpr T GetCount()\n    {\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    constexpr void Increment()\n    {\n        ++count;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n\n    T count{};\n};\n```\n\nAnd that's it, now we can add all these niceties to our main function.\n\n```cpp\n\n#include \"Adc.hpp\"\n#include \"Counter.hpp\"\n#include \"TCB.hpp\"\n\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <avr/interrupt.h>\n\nusing Adc0 = Adc<Adc0Addr, Adc8bitType>;\nusing Tcb = TCB<0>;\n\nCounter<uint8_t> clock{};\n\nvoid Analog::AdcInterrupts::ResReady()\n{\n    Adc0::ResetInterrupt();\n    trigger.Process(ADC0.RES, clock.GetCount());\n}\n\nvoid Timing::TCBInterrupts::TCB0Overflow()\n{\n    Tcb::ResetInterrupt();\n    clock.Increment();\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n\n    while(1)\n    {\n        ;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nWe use the relative time reference in the ADC interrupt, so that we know how much time has elapsed since we've received the previous samples.\nIn this interrupt there's a `trigger.Process()` function.\nIt is the function that will process the ADC data, together with the time reference, to compute the trigger state.\nHere's an example that shows how this function can use the relative time reference:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Trigger::Process(uint8_t data, uint8_t time) const\n{\n    // [...]\n\n    const uint8_t delta = this->trigTime + this->scanTime - time;\n\n    if(static_cast<int8_t>(delta) <= 0)\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // [...]\n}\n```\n\nAt some point in time, the ADC value exceeds a certain threshold, which in turn, puts the trigger in scan state.\nThe trigger remains in that state for `scanTime` milliseconds.\nDuring that time, the peak value of the signal is computed.\n\nThe question we answer here is: how do we know when the scan time is over?\nAnd the answer is simple: we check whether the signed representation of `delta` is positive or negative.\nAs soon as it becomes a negative value, we know that the scan time is over and we're done computing the signal's peak value.\nThus, we can go on and put the trigger in its next state, etc.\n\nThere we are, with a single byte we get a relative time reference that we can use to measure delays from 1 to 128 ms.\nWe don't need it to be an absolute time reference as long as we use a variable to memorize the start of the delay (`trigTime`).\nUsing this method, we can measure as many delays as we want as long they remain under 128 ms, and that we use a byte for each delay to memorize the when it starts.\nOf course this also works if we use a 16-bit variable (or even bigger), it is just faster to use a 8-bit variable on a 8-bit CPU.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nNext time we'll talk about signal processing.\nIn particular, we will see how to make a high-pass filter that performs well with a 8-bit microcontroller.\n\nSee you next time!\n","excerpt":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This is a series of posts.

So what can we do about that?\n\nHere's an example to illustrate our problem.\nSay we want to increment a counter every microsecond.\nWe are playing drums an hour or two every day, and we'd like our time reference to be absolute.\n\nLet's say we want to store our counter value in a 32-bit integer.\nThat leaves us with 4295 seconds before the counter overflows, which is slightly more than an hour.\nWe have three solutions:\n\n- Use a 64-bit variable, which will cause an overflow after a few billion years.\n- Increase the resolution of our timer to, say 1 ms, so that we get nearly 50 days before the variable overflows.\n- Work with a relative time reference instead of an absolute one.\n\nAll three options work, but we are interested in the latter, as this will allow us to store our count in a 16-bit, possibly a 8-bit variable.\n\nA relative time reference is a single variable that is incremented at regular interval.\nThe only difference with an absolute time reference is that we know it will overflow at some point, and that's not a problem.\n\n## Relative Time Reference\n\n### How it Works\n\nContrary to the absolute time reference, the relative time reference needs to be compared to another variable.\nFor instance, if a drum pad is hit, we get the value of our relative time reference (counter) and memorize it.\nAfter some time, we are going to check how much time has elapsed since we've memorized the time reference value.\n\n### Practical Example\n\nFirst of all, we need to state the requirements for our time reference.\nWe'd like to make a drum module, so the time reference will be used to manage the triggers states.\nThat includes the trig time, scan time, and mask time.\nFor those values, it would be nice to have a resolution of 0.1 or 0.5 ms, something like that.\nHowever, I will choose a step of 1 ms.\nThe main reason for that, is that 0.1 ms is too small and 0.5 ms could lead to confusion...\n\nLet's say we use a 8-bit variable for our counter.\nIt is incremented every millisecond, so it can count from zero to 255 ms.\nAnd it does so continuously until it overflows and goes back to zero.\n\nNow if a drum pad is hit, the trigger registers the current value of the counter.\nImagine that the value of the counter is 42. It is stored in a `trigTime` variable.\nWe set the scan time to 4 ms, which means the scan time will be done when the counter reaches 46.\nThe only thing we need to know is: is the counter greater or equal to 46.\n\nA problem arises if the counter overflows, though.\nLet's say the pad has been hit when the counter's value was 254.\nWe'll know that the scan time is over when the counter's value will be greater or equal to 258.\nBut our 8-bit variable will overflow before that, so we'll get the following sequence: 254, 255, 0, 1, 2, instead of 254, 255, 256, 257, 258.\n\nFortunately, we can do something about that.\nInstead of using unsigned integers, we can use signed integers, but we're going to go over a few other details before we do so.\nWe still use a 8-bit unsigned integer to store our counter's value, so it can go from 0 to 255.\nWe do the same for our scan time variable.\nIn order to determine if we have waited for a longer time than the scan time here's what we need to compute: `const uint8_t delta = trigTime + scanTime - currentTime;`.\n\nSo far, we still use an unsigned integer, but, let's examine precisely what happens with the previous values.\nWe have `trigTime = 254` and `scanTime = 4`.\nHere's what happens if we subtract the `currentTime` variable to the previous value:\n\n1. If `currentTime = 255` we get `delta =  254 + 4 - 255 = 3`.\n2. If `currentTime` overflows, for instance, `currentTime = 1`, we get `delta =  254 + 4 - 1 = 1`.\n3. If `currentTime` overflows, and we've waited longer than the scan time, for instance, `currentTime = 4`, we get `delta = 254 + 4 - 4 = 254`.\n\n### A Little Bit of Theory\n\nNow let's see what happens for a different value of `trigTime`: `trigTime = 120`, and consider a longer scanTime: `scanTime = 100`.\n\n1. If `currentTime = 128` we get `delta =  120 + 100 - 128 = 92`.\n2. If `currentTime` doesn't overflow, for instance, `currentTime = 200`, we get `delta =  120 + 100 - 200 = 20`.\n3. If `currentTime` doesn't overflow, and we've waited longer than the scan time, for instance, `currentTime = 240`, we get `delta = 120 + 100 - 240 = 236`.\n\nWe see something interesting here, for cases 1 and 2, delta remains below 127, but in both cases, point number 3 gives us a value that is above 128.\nThis is understandable, because if `currentTime >= trigTime + scanTime`, `deltat = rigTime + scanTime - currentTime` goes below zero.\nBut with unsigned integers, that means `delta` is now 255 minus something, so we get 254 or 236 in the second third case.\nNotice how the result is the same whether the value overflows or not!\n\nWhat that means is that perhaps we should treat `delta` as a signed integer.\nIt's important to note that, even if we treat `delta` as a signed integer, the underlying binary value of `delta` remains the same.\n\nA signed 8-bit integer goes from -128 to 127. The most significant bit, or MSB, determines the sign.\nIf that bit is set to 1, the value is negative, otherwise, it is positive.\nSo, if we count from zero, the value goes like this: 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 126, 127, -128, -127, -126, ..., -3, -2, -1.\nWhich is to be compared to a unsigned integer that goes like: 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, ..., 253, 254, 255.\nBoth sequences are different representations of the same binary value.\n\nThis means that `delta` is negative if the elapsed time since the trig time is longer than the scan time.\nBack to our first example, but this time using the signed representation of delta:\n\n1. If `currentTime = 255` we get `delta =  254 + 4 - 255 = 3`.\n2. If `currentTime` overflows, for instance, `currentTime = 2`, we get `delta =  254 + 4 - 2 = 0`.\n3. If `currentTime` overflows, and we've waited longer than the scan time, for instance, `currentTime = 4`, we get `delta = 254 + 4 - 4 = -2`.\n\nWe have the following three cases:\n\n- If we have waited less than the scan time duration, the value is positive.\n- If we have waited exactly the duration of the scan time, the value is zero.\n- If we have waited more than the scan time duration, the value is negative.\n\nLet's visualize what's happening here.\n\n![delta](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/delta.png)\n\nThe value of `delta` reaches 0 when the elapsed time since the trig time is exactly the scan time.\nFor an unsigned integer, the next value is 255, and if we cast `delta` to a signed integer, it is -1.\nThere are a few options to detect the transition:\n\n- We could simply test if the unsigned representation of `delta` is greater or equal to 128.\n- We could test the MSB of the unsigned representation of `delta`.\n- Or we could cast `delta` to a signed integer an check if the value is negative.\n\nI like the latter the most because it gives us a useful information for free: the elapsed time since the end of the scan time.\nThat time is equal to `-delta`.\nHowever, there's one thing that I didn't mention: we loose half of the values of our 8-bit integer.\nAll three options above lead to the same result, we can now only measure time differences that go from 0 to 128ms.\n\nIf you'd like a to read a slightly different explanation of this idea, please read the [following article from Lucky Resistor](https://luckyresistor.me/2019/07/10/real-time-counter-and-integer-overflow/).\n\n## Using TCB0 as a Real Time Counter\n\nWe are already using the TCA counter to trigger the ADC conversions, so we are going to use the TCB0 timer/counter instead.\n\n### Configure TCB0 and Handle Interrupts\n\nThe TCB timer/counter can do a lot of things, but we're only going to use it as a counter here.\nFirst of all, we define a class to handle the counters interrupts:\n\n```cpp\nclass TCBInterrupts\n{\n\npublic:\n    TCBInterrupts() = delete;\n    ~TCBInterrupts() = delete;\n\nprivate:\n\n    static void TCB0Overflow() __asm__(\"__vector_12\") __attribute__((__signal__, __used__, __externally_visible__));\n    static void TCB1Overflow() __asm__(\"__vector_13\") __attribute__((__signal__, __used__, __externally_visible__));\n\n};\n```\n\nAnd yes, \"counters\" with an \"s\", as there are 4 TCB timers.\nNote that I implemented the interrupts for TCB0 and TCB1 only.\n\nNow let's add a little helper to choose the right clock for TCB0:\n\n```cpp\nenum class TCBClock\n{\n    Div1,\n    Div2,\n    TCA\n};\n```\n\nWe'll use the same clock as TCA.\nAnd now a class to configure the TCB counters:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <uint8_t nb>\nclass TCB\n{\n\npublic:\n    TCB() = delete;\n    ~TCB() = delete;\n\n    static constexpr void EnableInterrupts()\n    {\n        tcb().INTCTRL =  TCB_CAPT_bm;\n    }\n\n    static constexpr void ResetInterrupt()\n    {\n        tcb().INTFLAGS |= TCB_CAPT_bm;\n    }\n\n    static constexpr void SetCompareOrCapture(uint16_t value)\n    {\n        tcb().CCMP = value;\n    }\n\n    static constexpr void Enable()\n    {\n        tcb().CTRLA |= TCB_ENABLE_bm;\n    }\n\n    template <TCBClock clock>\n    static constexpr void SetClock()\n    {\n        switch(clock)\n        {\n            case TCBClock::Div1: tcb().CTRLA |= TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV1_gc; break;\n            case TCBClock::Div2: tcb().CTRLA |= TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV2_gc; break;\n            case TCBClock::TCA: tcb().CTRLA |= TCB_CLKSEL_CLKTCA_gc; break;\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n\n    static constexpr auto& tcb()\n    {\n        switch(nb)\n        {\n            case 0: return TCB0;\n            case 1: return TCB1;\n            case 2: return TCB2;\n            case 3: return TCB3;\n            default: static_assert(nb <= 3, \"Wrong TCB number.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n};\n\n```\n\nThe functions names are self-explanatory.\n\n### A Real-Time Counter\n\nBefore we continue, we need one more ingredient: a counter.\nTo that end, I'll make a class template that will allow to choose the type of variable that the counter uses.\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename T>\nclass Counter\n{     \n\npublic:\n\n    Counter() = default;\n    ~Counter() = default;\n\n    constexpr T GetCount()\n    {\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    constexpr void Increment()\n    {\n        ++count;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n\n    T count{};\n};\n```\n\nAnd that's it, now we can add all these niceties to our main function.\n\n```cpp\n\n#include \"Adc.hpp\"\n#include \"Counter.hpp\"\n#include \"TCB.hpp\"\n\n#include <avr/io.h>\n#include <avr/interrupt.h>\n\nusing Adc0 = Adc<Adc0Addr, Adc8bitType>;\nusing Tcb = TCB<0>;\n\nCounter<uint8_t> clock{};\n\nvoid Analog::AdcInterrupts::ResReady()\n{\n    Adc0::ResetInterrupt();\n    trigger.Process(ADC0.RES, clock.GetCount());\n}\n\nvoid Timing::TCBInterrupts::TCB0Overflow()\n{\n    Tcb::ResetInterrupt();\n    clock.Increment();\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n\n    while(1)\n    {\n        ;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nWe use the relative time reference in the ADC interrupt, so that we know how much time has elapsed since we've received the previous samples.\nIn this interrupt there's a `trigger.Process()` function.\nIt is the function that will process the ADC data, together with the time reference, to compute the trigger state.\nHere's an example that shows how this function can use the relative time reference:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Trigger::Process(uint8_t data, uint8_t time) const\n{\n    // [...]\n\n    const uint8_t delta = this->trigTime + this->scanTime - time;\n\n    if(static_cast<int8_t>(delta) <= 0)\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // [...]\n}\n```\n\nAt some point in time, the ADC value exceeds a certain threshold, which in turn, puts the trigger in scan state.\nThe trigger remains in that state for `scanTime` milliseconds.\nDuring that time, the peak value of the signal is computed.\n\nThe question we answer here is: how do we know when the scan time is over?\nAnd the answer is simple: we check whether the signed representation of `delta` is positive or negative.\nAs soon as it becomes a negative value, we know that the scan time is over and we're done computing the signal's peak value.\nThus, we can go on and put the trigger in its next state, etc.\n\nThere we are, with a single byte we get a relative time reference that we can use to measure delays from 1 to 128 ms.\nWe don't need it to be an absolute time reference as long as we use a variable to memorize the start of the delay (`trigTime`).\nUsing this method, we can measure as many delays as we want as long they remain under 128 ms, and that we use a byte for each delay to memorize the when it starts.\nOf course this also works if we use a 16-bit variable (or even bigger), it is just faster to use a 8-bit variable on a 8-bit CPU.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nNext time we'll talk about signal processing.\nIn particular, we will see how to make a high-pass filter that performs well with a 8-bit microcontroller.\n\nSee you next time!\n","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1672680453683},"$loki":11},{"slug":"new-arduino-nano-every-board-part7","description":"This is a series of posts.

If you haven't read the previous part here's a link to it: [New Arduino Nano Every Trigger Board - Part 6](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part6).\n\nIn this part, we are going to talk about digital filtering.\nThe board that was made for this project adds a DC offset to the signal to keep the voltage above 0V, as shown below.\n\n![Circuit](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/Piezo-circuit.png)\n\nIf we get bytes from the ADC, the values are going to be centered around 127, and go from 0 to 255.\nHowever, the offset won't always be exactly 127, as it depends on a voltage source and a voltage divider.\nThe offset may vary over time, so we can't really subtract 127 to the value read by the ADC.\nThis is why we need a high-pass filter.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## High-pass Filter in Electronics\n\nIn electronics, a high-pass filter is made of two components: a resistor and a capacitor.\nThe capacitor naturally acts as a high-pass filter, but a resistor is required in order to control the cutoff frequency of the filter.\n\nFor a first order, RC, high-pass filter, the cutoff frequency is given by fc = 1/(2πRC).\nFor instance, the association of a 10 kΩ resistor and a 1 µF capacitor gives fc ≈ 16 Hz.\nThe signal amplitude below 16 Hz will be attenuated, which means that any DC offset will be automatically removed.\n\nIt means that, using such a high-pass filter, a signal that takes values from 0 to 255 while being centered around 127, will be shifted so that it is centered around zero and takes values that go from -127 to 128.\nAs a side-effect, the lowest frequencies (below 16 Hz) will also be filtered, but in our case, that is negligible.\n\n## Algorithmic Implementation\n\nWithout going into too much detail, the RC high-pass filter can be translated into equations that can then be translated into a simple algorithm.\nThe output value `out` depends only on the input `in` and the values of R and C.\nTime is 'translated' to indices, so `i` represents the time.\nThe output of the system is given by `out[i] = α × (out[i−1] + in[i] − in[i−1])`, where `α = RC / (RC + dt)`, `dt` being the elapsed time between samples `i` and `i+1`.\nSo we only need to know the previous output sample, and the current and previous input samples to compute the new output value.\n\nThis is fairly easy to implement, however, there is a problem.\nThe above algorithm requires the use of floating-point number.\nWhen dealing with a 8-bit microcontroller, this can become problematic.\n\nEnter the world of fixed-point arithmetic!\n\n## Fixed-Point DC Blocking Filter\n\n### DC Blocking Filter\n\nA DC blocking filter is not exactly the same thing as a high-pass filter.\nLet's focus a little bit on [digital filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter).\nWhen dealing with digital filtering, filters are described using the so called [Z-transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform).\nOne advantage I see in doing so, is that it's easy to reason about complex filters.\n\nFor instance, let's consider a simple high-pass filter.\nIn digital signal processing, its transfer function can be described as:\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"T(z) = \\frac{out(z)}{in(z)} = \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 - pz^{-1}}  \">\n  <mrow>\n    <mi>T</mi>\n    <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo>\n    <mi>z</mi>\n    <mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo>\n        <mi>z</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo>\n        <mi>z</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n        <mo>-</mo>\n        <msup>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>z</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </msup>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n        <mo>-</mo>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <msup>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>z</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </msup>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n\nThe parameter *p* is a pole, and has a big influence on the filter's transfer function, as shown on the figure below:\n\n![HPFilter](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/hp.svg)\n\nBy the way, I used Octave to create this figure, here's the code to replicate it:\n\n```matlab\nps = [0 0.5 0.9 0.99];\n\nfor p = ps\n\n    p\n    b = [1 -1];\n    a = [1 -p];\n\n\n    [h, w] = freqz(b, a);\n\n    n = length(w);\n    \n    plot(w(1:n/2), 20*log10(abs(h(1:n/2))), \"linewidth\", 3);\n    hold on;\n\nendfor\n\nxlabel('Freq. (rad/s)');\nylabel('Gain (dB)');\ngrid on;\nlegend(\"show\")\nlegend(\"p = 0\", \"p = 0.5\", \"p = 0.9\", \"p = 0.99\")\nset(gca, \"linewidth\", 3, \"fontsize\", 14)\n```\n\nWhat we'd like is to have something that's close to the curve given by *p = 0.99*, as it blocks DC values and keeps all higher frequencies.\n\n### Fixed-Point Arithmetic\n\nClearly, the main advantage of fixed-point arithmetic is speed.\nThe Arduino Nano Every doesn't have a floating-point unit, so every operation that involves floating-point numbers is super slow, as it requires a lot of instructions. Multiplying two floats (that are 32-bit numbers) takes several milliseconds, which is way too long for our purposes.\n\nOur goal is to find a way to perform the high-pass filtering operation using algorithms that operate on bytes.\nThis will involve fixed-point operations, but will also require a few tricks to make things work as expected.\n\n### Fixed-Point DC Blocker\n\nWe can use the previous equation to compute the current output value as a function of the previous output value, and the current and previous input values:\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"y[n] = p y[n - 1] + x[n] - x[n - 1] \">\n  <mrow>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n<br>\n\nWhere *y* is the output and *x* is the input.\nOf course this formula is valid if we use floating-point numbers.\nHowever, we can notice that this is equation can be applied in two distinct steps:\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"w[n] = x[n] - x[n-1] \">\n  <mrow>\n    <mi>d</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"y[n] = p\\,y[n-1] + w[n] \">\n  <mrow>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <mi>d</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n<br>\nThe first step represents a differentiator, and the second step a leaky integrator.\nThe differentiator has the transfer function of the very first equation when p = 0, so it's basically a DC blocker, but it blocks more than just low frequencies.\nThanks to the leaky integrator, those frequencies are less attenuated, so it's definitely what we want to obtain.\n\n### Understanding and Prototyping a Fixed-Point DC Blocker\n\nUsing integers instead of floats results in quantization errors, especially due to the leaky integrator.\nFurthermore, how do we deal with *p*, whose value lies between 0 and 1?\nLet's assume that the input is an unsigned 8-bit integer, and the output is a signed 8-bit integer.\nThe input values go from 0 to 255 whereas the output values go from -127 to 128.\n\nBefore rushing into it, let's make a little detour and try to implement the DC blocker algorithm using Octave.\nWe need to convert the previous equations into something we can use in a fixed-point algorithm.\nHere's what we have so far:\n\n- x<sub>n</sub> is the input of the DC blocker.\n- d<sub>n</sub> is the output of the differentiator.\n- y<sub>n</sub> is the output of the DC blocker.\n\nNow we're going to have to use the previous equation with integers, so at some point, we'll have a quantization that will introduce a quantization error: e<sub>n</sub>.\nThe technique that we are going to use is called fraction-saving, it works very well when *p* is close to 1.\nIt consists in memorizing the round-off error of the previous sample and subtract it to the next sample, to minimize that error.\n\nSo now we need and extra variable to store the error.\nThe thing is that it's possible to overflow the 8-bit capacity, because we'll add the previous value of the error, e<sub>n-1</sub>.\nWe have no choice but to make our new variable a 16-bit integer to store the extra bit that might be required. Fortunately, the ATMega4809 can perform some 16-bit operations very efficiently, so that's not a big deal.\nTo optimize things as much as possible, we'll use this variable to store the error as well as the current value of y<sub>n</sub>.\n\nIt's now time to do some prototyping and testing.\nLet's call the new variable *acc*. We can store the quantized value of y<sub>n</sub> in the upper 9 bits (to avoid any overflow) of *acc* and e<sub>n</sub> in the lower 7 bits.  \nWe'll use Octave to make sure everything works out before we implement the final filter in C++.\n\nTo that end, we'll introduce three main variables, `prevX`, `prevY` and `acc`.\nThe names speak for themselves.\nOur test will consist of an input of 100 samples that basically repeat the values 77 and 177 until the end of the sequence.\nThis input signal is centered around 127 and oscillates from 77 to 177.\nIf the DC component is removed, we'll end up with an output that is centered around 0 and goes from -50 to +50.\n\nHere's the code for our prototype, with p = 0.98:\n\n```matlab\nprevX = int16(0);\nprevY = int16(0);\nacc = int16(0);\n\nxa = repmat([uint8(77), uint8(177)], [1, 50]);\n\nt = linspace(0, length(xa), length(xa));\n\ny = [];\n\nfor x = xa\n                                    % acc = y_{n-1} << 7 - e_{n-1}\n  acc = acc - prevX;                % acc = acc - x_{n-1} << 7\n  prevX = bitshift(int16(x), 7);    % prevX = x_n << 7\n  acc = acc + prevX;                % acc = acc + x_n << 7 - e_{n-1}\n  % d_n is now in the upper 9 bits of acc\n  % acc = (y_{n-1} + d_n )<< 7 - e_{n-1}\n  acc = acc - prevY * 256*(1 - .98);% acc = acc - y_{n-1} * (1<<8 * (1 - p)) - e_{n-1}\n  % acc = [ y_{n-1} - y_{n-1} * (1<<8 * (1 - p)) + d_n ] << 7 - e_{n-1}\n  prevY = bitshift(acc, -7);        % prevY = acc >> 7 + e_n (error introduced by quantization)\n  y = [y; prevY];\n\nendfor\n\nplot(t, y)\n```\n\nAnd here's the result:\n\n![DCBlocker](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/dc_blocker.svg)\n\nAs expected, after a transient phase, the signal oscillates between -50 ans 50.\nThe transient phase is tightly related to the value of *p*.\nThe closer *p* gets to 1, the longer the transient.\n\nNow, let's dig into the code and got through the comments.\nFirst of all, let's assume that the loop already iterated at least once.\nThe *acc* variable holds y<sub>n-1</sub> << 7 - e<sub>n-1</sub>.\n\nFirstly, we perform the following operation: acc = acc - x<sub>n-1</sub> << 7, which means that the upper 9 bits of *acc* are now y<sub>n-1</sub> - x<sub>n-1</sub>.\nWe then store x<sub>n</sub> into the upper 9 bits of *prevX*, and add that value to *acc*.\nAt this point, we have acc = y<sub>n-1</sub> - x<sub>n-1</sub> - e<sub>n-1</sub> (remember that the initial value of *acc* held the value -e<sub>n-1</sub> in its lowest bits).\n\nAlright, now we encounter that line: `acc = acc - prevY * 256*(1 - .98);`.\nWithout going into too much detail, if we take the previous equations, we get:\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"y_n = Q{p\\,y_{n-1} + d_n -

prevY * 256*(1 - .98);` makes a lot of sense, as this is almost exactly the equation we've just written.\nI say almost for two reasons.\nThe first one is that the term e<sub>n</sub> is missing for now, as it is introduced by the next line of code.\nThe other reason is that the equation doesn't show the `256` that is basically a normalization factor so that *p* no longer acts on floats, but on bytes instead (8-bit integers).\nBy the way, in practice, the value 256*(1 - .98) is not 5.12 as it should be because we're not dealing with floating-point numbers.\nSo, we should replace that whole expression by 5, which means that p = 0.9805.\n\nThat means not all values of *p* are allowed.\nFor instance, excluding 1, the first 10 values of *p* are: 0.9961, 0.9922, 0.9883, 0.9844, 0.9805, 0.9766, 0.9727, 0.9688, 0.9648, 0.9609.\n\nNow all that's left is the step where the quantization actually happens, which corresponds to the very last operation of the loop.\nThat line translates to `prevY = acc >> 7;` in C++.\nYou may notice that this means *prevY* could be an 8-bit integer instead of a 16-bit one, but that would make the code a tad more complex, so we'll keep a 16-bit integer.\n\nSince the quantization happens here, this line is equivalent to prevY = y<sub>n</sub> + e<sub>n</sub> - e<sub>n-1</sub>, because we introduced the term -e<sub>n-1</sub> a few lines ago on purpose.\nAs we can see, this explains why we assumed that acc = y<sub>n-1</sub> << 7 - e<sub>n-1</sub> at the beginning.\nThis also shows that we found a way to compensate for the quantization error.\n\n## Fixed-Point DC Blocker Implementation in C and C++\n\nSo far, everything behaves as expected.\nThanks to a few tricks, we've optimized things quite a lot and are down to a few lines of code to perform the DC blocking operation.\nAll the operations that are involved operate on 16-bit integer. They are mainly additions and subtraction, however, there is one multiplication involved.\n\nWe know that we need to multiply *prevY* by 256*(1 - p).\nAs I have already explained, using integer types limits the possible values.\nThat's why there are only 10 possible values between p = 0.996 and p = 0.96.\nBut if we restrict the values even more, we can make sure that our final multiplication end-up being a multiple of two.\nThis means that it won't be a multiplication anymore, but a simple bit shift operation, which is a lot more efficient.\nSimply put, that limitation leads to these four values between 0.996 and 0.96: 0.9961, 0.9922, 0.9844, 0.9688.\n\nLet's choose p = 0.9922, that lead us to a multiplication by 2.\nHere's how it translates in C++ ([and can easily be adapted to C](https://dspguru.com/dsp/tricks/fixed-point-dc-blocking-filter-with-noise-shaping/)):\n\n```cpp\n\nstatic int16_t prevX = 0;\nstatic int16_t prevY = 0;\nstatic int16_t acc = 0;\n\nint8_t RemoveDC(uint8_t x)\n{\n\n  acc   -= prevX;\n  prevX = static_cast<int16_t>(x) << 7;\n  acc   += prevX;\n  acc   -= prevY << 2; // p = .9922 => 256 * (1 - p) = 2\n  prevY = acc >> 7;\n\n  return static_cast<int8_t>(prevY);\n}\n```\n\nHere we are, only 5 lines of code to perform a DC blocking operation, using only additions, subtractions, and bit shift operations.\nOn a ATMega4809 clocked at 16MHz that is less than 10µs of execution time, that's just perfect!\n\nBefore concluding, I think it's worth mentioning that the transient response of the DC blocker lasts for about 350 samples.\nThat's not a lot, rounding up to 400 samples, that's 4ms at 100ksps, not too bad.\n\n## From a DC Blocker to a C++ Drum Trigger\n\nSo, what happens after we remove the DC offset from the input signal?\nIn the [previous part of this series](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part6), we've imagined a `Trigger` class that would contain a `Process` method:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Trigger::Process(uint8_t data, uint8_t time) const\n{\n    // [...]\n\n    const uint8_t delta = this->trigTime + this->scanTime - time;\n\n    if(static_cast<int8_t>(delta) <= 0)\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // [...]\n}\n```\n\nWe knew what to do with the `time` variable, now we know what to do with the `data` variable.\nFirst of all, it has to go through the `RemoveDC` function, and then, we can take the absolute value of the filtered signal and apply some peak detection and other algorithms to it.\nThe code is on [Github](https://github.com/SpintroniK/exadrumino-Nano-Every/blob/de670fde4b6f3fe18d61a9d21d77866de8024d00/src/Module/Trigger.hpp#L25), but if you only care about the `Process` method, here's a snippet:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Process(uint8_t value, uint8_t currentTime) noexcept\n{\n    acc   -= prevX;\n    prevX = static_cast<int16_t>(value) << 7;\n    acc   += prevX;\n    acc   -= prevY << 2;\n    prevY = acc >> 7;\n\n    const uint8_t velocity = ::abs(prevY);\n\n\n    if(state == 0) // Idle\n    {\n        if(velocity >= threshold)\n        {\n            trigTime = currentTime;\n            state = 1;\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if(state == 1) // Scan\n    {\n        maxVelocity = velocity > maxVelocity ? velocity : maxVelocity;\n        maxVelocity = maxVelocity >= 127 ? 127 : maxVelocity;\n\n        const uint8_t delta = trigTime + scanTime - currentTime;\n        if(static_cast<int8_t>(delta) <= 0)\n        {\n            state = 2;\n            trigVelocity = maxVelocity;\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if(state == 2)\n    {\n        const uint8_t delta = trigTime + maskTime - currentTime;\n        if(static_cast<int8_t>(delta) <= 0)\n        {\n            state = 0;\n            maxVelocity = 0;\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nIt is basically a state machine.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nNext time we'll talk about how to read and write values to the Arduino's EEPROM.\n\nHappy new year, and see you next time!\n","excerpt":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This is a series of posts.

If you haven't read the previous part here's a link to it: [New Arduino Nano Every Trigger Board - Part 6](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part6).\n\nIn this part, we are going to talk about digital filtering.\nThe board that was made for this project adds a DC offset to the signal to keep the voltage above 0V, as shown below.\n\n![Circuit](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/Piezo-circuit.png)\n\nIf we get bytes from the ADC, the values are going to be centered around 127, and go from 0 to 255.\nHowever, the offset won't always be exactly 127, as it depends on a voltage source and a voltage divider.\nThe offset may vary over time, so we can't really subtract 127 to the value read by the ADC.\nThis is why we need a high-pass filter.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## High-pass Filter in Electronics\n\nIn electronics, a high-pass filter is made of two components: a resistor and a capacitor.\nThe capacitor naturally acts as a high-pass filter, but a resistor is required in order to control the cutoff frequency of the filter.\n\nFor a first order, RC, high-pass filter, the cutoff frequency is given by fc = 1/(2πRC).\nFor instance, the association of a 10 kΩ resistor and a 1 µF capacitor gives fc ≈ 16 Hz.\nThe signal amplitude below 16 Hz will be attenuated, which means that any DC offset will be automatically removed.\n\nIt means that, using such a high-pass filter, a signal that takes values from 0 to 255 while being centered around 127, will be shifted so that it is centered around zero and takes values that go from -127 to 128.\nAs a side-effect, the lowest frequencies (below 16 Hz) will also be filtered, but in our case, that is negligible.\n\n## Algorithmic Implementation\n\nWithout going into too much detail, the RC high-pass filter can be translated into equations that can then be translated into a simple algorithm.\nThe output value `out` depends only on the input `in` and the values of R and C.\nTime is 'translated' to indices, so `i` represents the time.\nThe output of the system is given by `out[i] = α × (out[i−1] + in[i] − in[i−1])`, where `α = RC / (RC + dt)`, `dt` being the elapsed time between samples `i` and `i+1`.\nSo we only need to know the previous output sample, and the current and previous input samples to compute the new output value.\n\nThis is fairly easy to implement, however, there is a problem.\nThe above algorithm requires the use of floating-point number.\nWhen dealing with a 8-bit microcontroller, this can become problematic.\n\nEnter the world of fixed-point arithmetic!\n\n## Fixed-Point DC Blocking Filter\n\n### DC Blocking Filter\n\nA DC blocking filter is not exactly the same thing as a high-pass filter.\nLet's focus a little bit on [digital filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter).\nWhen dealing with digital filtering, filters are described using the so called [Z-transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform).\nOne advantage I see in doing so, is that it's easy to reason about complex filters.\n\nFor instance, let's consider a simple high-pass filter.\nIn digital signal processing, its transfer function can be described as:\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"T(z) = \\frac{out(z)}{in(z)} = \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 - pz^{-1}}  \">\n  <mrow>\n    <mi>T</mi>\n    <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo>\n    <mi>z</mi>\n    <mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo>\n        <mi>z</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo>\n        <mi>z</mi>\n        <mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n        <mo>-</mo>\n        <msup>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>z</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </msup>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mn>1</mn>\n        <mo>-</mo>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <msup>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>z</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mo>-</mo>\n            <mn>1</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </msup>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n\nThe parameter *p* is a pole, and has a big influence on the filter's transfer function, as shown on the figure below:\n\n![HPFilter](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/hp.svg)\n\nBy the way, I used Octave to create this figure, here's the code to replicate it:\n\n```matlab\nps = [0 0.5 0.9 0.99];\n\nfor p = ps\n\n    p\n    b = [1 -1];\n    a = [1 -p];\n\n\n    [h, w] = freqz(b, a);\n\n    n = length(w);\n    \n    plot(w(1:n/2), 20*log10(abs(h(1:n/2))), \"linewidth\", 3);\n    hold on;\n\nendfor\n\nxlabel('Freq. (rad/s)');\nylabel('Gain (dB)');\ngrid on;\nlegend(\"show\")\nlegend(\"p = 0\", \"p = 0.5\", \"p = 0.9\", \"p = 0.99\")\nset(gca, \"linewidth\", 3, \"fontsize\", 14)\n```\n\nWhat we'd like is to have something that's close to the curve given by *p = 0.99*, as it blocks DC values and keeps all higher frequencies.\n\n### Fixed-Point Arithmetic\n\nClearly, the main advantage of fixed-point arithmetic is speed.\nThe Arduino Nano Every doesn't have a floating-point unit, so every operation that involves floating-point numbers is super slow, as it requires a lot of instructions. Multiplying two floats (that are 32-bit numbers) takes several milliseconds, which is way too long for our purposes.\n\nOur goal is to find a way to perform the high-pass filtering operation using algorithms that operate on bytes.\nThis will involve fixed-point operations, but will also require a few tricks to make things work as expected.\n\n### Fixed-Point DC Blocker\n\nWe can use the previous equation to compute the current output value as a function of the previous output value, and the current and previous input values:\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"y[n] = p y[n - 1] + x[n] - x[n - 1] \">\n  <mrow>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n<br>\n\nWhere *y* is the output and *x* is the input.\nOf course this formula is valid if we use floating-point numbers.\nHowever, we can notice that this is equation can be applied in two distinct steps:\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"w[n] = x[n] - x[n-1] \">\n  <mrow>\n    <mi>d</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mi>x</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"y[n] = p\\,y[n-1] + w[n] \">\n  <mrow>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi>p</mi>\n    <mi>y</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>-</mo>\n    <mn>1</mn>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n    <mo>+</mo>\n    <mi>d</mi>\n    <mi>[</mi>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mi>]</mi>\n  </mrow>\n</math>\n<br>\nThe first step represents a differentiator, and the second step a leaky integrator.\nThe differentiator has the transfer function of the very first equation when p = 0, so it's basically a DC blocker, but it blocks more than just low frequencies.\nThanks to the leaky integrator, those frequencies are less attenuated, so it's definitely what we want to obtain.\n\n### Understanding and Prototyping a Fixed-Point DC Blocker\n\nUsing integers instead of floats results in quantization errors, especially due to the leaky integrator.\nFurthermore, how do we deal with *p*, whose value lies between 0 and 1?\nLet's assume that the input is an unsigned 8-bit integer, and the output is a signed 8-bit integer.\nThe input values go from 0 to 255 whereas the output values go from -127 to 128.\n\nBefore rushing into it, let's make a little detour and try to implement the DC blocker algorithm using Octave.\nWe need to convert the previous equations into something we can use in a fixed-point algorithm.\nHere's what we have so far:\n\n- x<sub>n</sub> is the input of the DC blocker.\n- d<sub>n</sub> is the output of the differentiator.\n- y<sub>n</sub> is the output of the DC blocker.\n\nNow we're going to have to use the previous equation with integers, so at some point, we'll have a quantization that will introduce a quantization error: e<sub>n</sub>.\nThe technique that we are going to use is called fraction-saving, it works very well when *p* is close to 1.\nIt consists in memorizing the round-off error of the previous sample and subtract it to the next sample, to minimize that error.\n\nSo now we need and extra variable to store the error.\nThe thing is that it's possible to overflow the 8-bit capacity, because we'll add the previous value of the error, e<sub>n-1</sub>.\nWe have no choice but to make our new variable a 16-bit integer to store the extra bit that might be required. Fortunately, the ATMega4809 can perform some 16-bit operations very efficiently, so that's not a big deal.\nTo optimize things as much as possible, we'll use this variable to store the error as well as the current value of y<sub>n</sub>.\n\nIt's now time to do some prototyping and testing.\nLet's call the new variable *acc*. We can store the quantized value of y<sub>n</sub> in the upper 9 bits (to avoid any overflow) of *acc* and e<sub>n</sub> in the lower 7 bits.  \nWe'll use Octave to make sure everything works out before we implement the final filter in C++.\n\nTo that end, we'll introduce three main variables, `prevX`, `prevY` and `acc`.\nThe names speak for themselves.\nOur test will consist of an input of 100 samples that basically repeat the values 77 and 177 until the end of the sequence.\nThis input signal is centered around 127 and oscillates from 77 to 177.\nIf the DC component is removed, we'll end up with an output that is centered around 0 and goes from -50 to +50.\n\nHere's the code for our prototype, with p = 0.98:\n\n```matlab\nprevX = int16(0);\nprevY = int16(0);\nacc = int16(0);\n\nxa = repmat([uint8(77), uint8(177)], [1, 50]);\n\nt = linspace(0, length(xa), length(xa));\n\ny = [];\n\nfor x = xa\n                                    % acc = y_{n-1} << 7 - e_{n-1}\n  acc = acc - prevX;                % acc = acc - x_{n-1} << 7\n  prevX = bitshift(int16(x), 7);    % prevX = x_n << 7\n  acc = acc + prevX;                % acc = acc + x_n << 7 - e_{n-1}\n  % d_n is now in the upper 9 bits of acc\n  % acc = (y_{n-1} + d_n )<< 7 - e_{n-1}\n  acc = acc - prevY * 256*(1 - .98);% acc = acc - y_{n-1} * (1<<8 * (1 - p)) - e_{n-1}\n  % acc = [ y_{n-1} - y_{n-1} * (1<<8 * (1 - p)) + d_n ] << 7 - e_{n-1}\n  prevY = bitshift(acc, -7);        % prevY = acc >> 7 + e_n (error introduced by quantization)\n  y = [y; prevY];\n\nendfor\n\nplot(t, y)\n```\n\nAnd here's the result:\n\n![DCBlocker](/images/new-arduino-nano-every-board/dc_blocker.svg)\n\nAs expected, after a transient phase, the signal oscillates between -50 ans 50.\nThe transient phase is tightly related to the value of *p*.\nThe closer *p* gets to 1, the longer the transient.\n\nNow, let's dig into the code and got through the comments.\nFirst of all, let's assume that the loop already iterated at least once.\nThe *acc* variable holds y<sub>n-1</sub> << 7 - e<sub>n-1</sub>.\n\nFirstly, we perform the following operation: acc = acc - x<sub>n-1</sub> << 7, which means that the upper 9 bits of *acc* are now y<sub>n-1</sub> - x<sub>n-1</sub>.\nWe then store x<sub>n</sub> into the upper 9 bits of *prevX*, and add that value to *acc*.\nAt this point, we have acc = y<sub>n-1</sub> - x<sub>n-1</sub> - e<sub>n-1</sub> (remember that the initial value of *acc* held the value -e<sub>n-1</sub> in its lowest bits).\n\nAlright, now we encounter that line: `acc = acc - prevY * 256*(1 - .98);`.\nWithout going into too much detail, if we take the previous equations, we get:\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\" title=\"y_n = Q{p\\,y_{n-1} + d_n -

prevY * 256*(1 - .98);` makes a lot of sense, as this is almost exactly the equation we've just written.\nI say almost for two reasons.\nThe first one is that the term e<sub>n</sub> is missing for now, as it is introduced by the next line of code.\nThe other reason is that the equation doesn't show the `256` that is basically a normalization factor so that *p* no longer acts on floats, but on bytes instead (8-bit integers).\nBy the way, in practice, the value 256*(1 - .98) is not 5.12 as it should be because we're not dealing with floating-point numbers.\nSo, we should replace that whole expression by 5, which means that p = 0.9805.\n\nThat means not all values of *p* are allowed.\nFor instance, excluding 1, the first 10 values of *p* are: 0.9961, 0.9922, 0.9883, 0.9844, 0.9805, 0.9766, 0.9727, 0.9688, 0.9648, 0.9609.\n\nNow all that's left is the step where the quantization actually happens, which corresponds to the very last operation of the loop.\nThat line translates to `prevY = acc >> 7;` in C++.\nYou may notice that this means *prevY* could be an 8-bit integer instead of a 16-bit one, but that would make the code a tad more complex, so we'll keep a 16-bit integer.\n\nSince the quantization happens here, this line is equivalent to prevY = y<sub>n</sub> + e<sub>n</sub> - e<sub>n-1</sub>, because we introduced the term -e<sub>n-1</sub> a few lines ago on purpose.\nAs we can see, this explains why we assumed that acc = y<sub>n-1</sub> << 7 - e<sub>n-1</sub> at the beginning.\nThis also shows that we found a way to compensate for the quantization error.\n\n## Fixed-Point DC Blocker Implementation in C and C++\n\nSo far, everything behaves as expected.\nThanks to a few tricks, we've optimized things quite a lot and are down to a few lines of code to perform the DC blocking operation.\nAll the operations that are involved operate on 16-bit integer. They are mainly additions and subtraction, however, there is one multiplication involved.\n\nWe know that we need to multiply *prevY* by 256*(1 - p).\nAs I have already explained, using integer types limits the possible values.\nThat's why there are only 10 possible values between p = 0.996 and p = 0.96.\nBut if we restrict the values even more, we can make sure that our final multiplication end-up being a multiple of two.\nThis means that it won't be a multiplication anymore, but a simple bit shift operation, which is a lot more efficient.\nSimply put, that limitation leads to these four values between 0.996 and 0.96: 0.9961, 0.9922, 0.9844, 0.9688.\n\nLet's choose p = 0.9922, that lead us to a multiplication by 2.\nHere's how it translates in C++ ([and can easily be adapted to C](https://dspguru.com/dsp/tricks/fixed-point-dc-blocking-filter-with-noise-shaping/)):\n\n```cpp\n\nstatic int16_t prevX = 0;\nstatic int16_t prevY = 0;\nstatic int16_t acc = 0;\n\nint8_t RemoveDC(uint8_t x)\n{\n\n  acc   -= prevX;\n  prevX = static_cast<int16_t>(x) << 7;\n  acc   += prevX;\n  acc   -= prevY << 2; // p = .9922 => 256 * (1 - p) = 2\n  prevY = acc >> 7;\n\n  return static_cast<int8_t>(prevY);\n}\n```\n\nHere we are, only 5 lines of code to perform a DC blocking operation, using only additions, subtractions, and bit shift operations.\nOn a ATMega4809 clocked at 16MHz that is less than 10µs of execution time, that's just perfect!\n\nBefore concluding, I think it's worth mentioning that the transient response of the DC blocker lasts for about 350 samples.\nThat's not a lot, rounding up to 400 samples, that's 4ms at 100ksps, not too bad.\n\n## From a DC Blocker to a C++ Drum Trigger\n\nSo, what happens after we remove the DC offset from the input signal?\nIn the [previous part of this series](/article/new-arduino-nano-every-board-part6), we've imagined a `Trigger` class that would contain a `Process` method:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Trigger::Process(uint8_t data, uint8_t time) const\n{\n    // [...]\n\n    const uint8_t delta = this->trigTime + this->scanTime - time;\n\n    if(static_cast<int8_t>(delta) <= 0)\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // [...]\n}\n```\n\nWe knew what to do with the `time` variable, now we know what to do with the `data` variable.\nFirst of all, it has to go through the `RemoveDC` function, and then, we can take the absolute value of the filtered signal and apply some peak detection and other algorithms to it.\nThe code is on [Github](https://github.com/SpintroniK/exadrumino-Nano-Every/blob/de670fde4b6f3fe18d61a9d21d77866de8024d00/src/Module/Trigger.hpp#L25), but if you only care about the `Process` method, here's a snippet:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Process(uint8_t value, uint8_t currentTime) noexcept\n{\n    acc   -= prevX;\n    prevX = static_cast<int16_t>(value) << 7;\n    acc   += prevX;\n    acc   -= prevY << 2;\n    prevY = acc >> 7;\n\n    const uint8_t velocity = ::abs(prevY);\n\n\n    if(state == 0) // Idle\n    {\n        if(velocity >= threshold)\n        {\n            trigTime = currentTime;\n            state = 1;\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if(state == 1) // Scan\n    {\n        maxVelocity = velocity > maxVelocity ? velocity : maxVelocity;\n        maxVelocity = maxVelocity >= 127 ? 127 : maxVelocity;\n\n        const uint8_t delta = trigTime + scanTime - currentTime;\n        if(static_cast<int8_t>(delta) <= 0)\n        {\n            state = 2;\n            trigVelocity = maxVelocity;\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if(state == 2)\n    {\n        const uint8_t delta = trigTime + maskTime - currentTime;\n        if(static_cast<int8_t>(delta) <= 0)\n        {\n            state = 0;\n            maxVelocity = 0;\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nIt is basically a state machine.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nNext time we'll talk about how to read and write values to the Arduino's EEPROM.\n\nHappy new year, and see you next time!\n","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1672680453739},"$loki":12},{"slug":"new-spi-sensors-config","description":"Exadrums 0.7.0 is currently under development.
