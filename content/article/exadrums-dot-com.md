The official exadrums website, [exadrums.com](https://exadrums.com), is online.
It shows that there's more than a just software to exadrums.
Even though it is more a landing page than a website, it gives valuable information about the project.
And frankly, I'm quite proud of the video!

The website's goal is also to explain how to build an exadrums module.
Building the whole module (which is currently designed to work with the Roland TD4-KP), requires three main steps:

- To install the software on a Raspberry Pi
- To make the trigger input board.
- To 3D-print the enclosure.

Just so you know, you don't have to go through each step, as you can already play a fair bit with the software even on your PC or laptop.

There is also this _Make your Own_ button, which redirects to another web page that is currently under construction.
This page will be a custom user guide generator.

The idea is that everyone wants something different (or have a different drum set configuration), so it makes sense to have a custom user guide.
I'll keep you informed about the progress I make on that page.
It should be available in a few weeks, or a few months.
I'm not in a rush, as my goal is to make the best user guide possible.
