You might not now that you can export and import your exadrums configuration.
This is a simple feature, but it can be very useful to create backups of your drum kits, or share them.
The first eXaDrums triggers input board has been designed for the Roland TD-4KP.
Wouldn't be nice to save all the triggers settings, instruments sounds, etc. for this drum kit, so that anyone can play with the TD-4KP?
Here's why I'm sharing the configuration I've been using for my tests on that drum kit: [https://github.com/SpintroniK/exadrums-data/tree/TD-4KP](https://github.com/SpintroniK/exadrums-data/tree/TD-4KP).

If you click on the link, you'll notice that there's a little Readme file to help you install the kit.
It's a very simple and quick operation.

With any luck, reading this post will make you want to export some of your kits.
I think this is one of the steps that will add a social dimension to exadrums, so be prepared to see more things going in that direction in the future!
