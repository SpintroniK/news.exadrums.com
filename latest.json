If you're using Debian (or Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and potentially some other Debian-based distros), you can install exadrums via `apt`, i.e.:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install exadrums\n```\n<!--more-->\n\n## What does this mean?\n\nWell, if you have about 5 MB to spare, you can install exadrums from the command line directly.\nHere's what you see from a fresh Debian Bullseye install:\n\n![image](/images/debian-bullseye/Screenshot_2021-08-15_11-14-02.png)\n\nNo more compiling, etc. `apt` handles everything for you!\n\n## What about Raspberry Pi OS?\n\nIt's only been a few hours since Debian 11 has been released, so there's no news about the next Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian). Let's give them some time to publish a proper release.\nI can already tell you that you'll get the same version of exadrums as Debian in Raspberry Pi OS, it'll be exadrums 0.6.0.\n\nAnyhow, when the new Raspberry Pi OS will be released, you'll be able to install exadrums via `apt` on your Raspberry Pi.\n",
