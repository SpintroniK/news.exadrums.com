The whole drum module is in the library, and exposes a C++ API. That means libexadrums can be used with other languages, such as Python, Javascript, etc.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nA C++ user interface has its advantages, but exadrums could benefit from other languages. For instance,  a more \"connected\" experience would be easier to implement in Python or Javascript.\n\nAnd that's how I see the future of exadrums: a Connected Open Source Drum Module. Some things are already in the works, but others will take some time. However, I'll do my best to publish news more frequently, to keep you informed about the project.\n\nAbout that, the project website [exadrums.com](https://exadrums.com) will be online pretty soon! Hope you'll like it.\n",
